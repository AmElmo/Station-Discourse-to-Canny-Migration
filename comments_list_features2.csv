","Yes! This is really a must have and the one thing that might cause me to stop
using this app. Not only is it annoying to have to configure a service
manually, but once I get logged out of that service (which most only cache
credentials for 2 weeks) I have to manually re-add them all over again.

Integration of PW-Manager Software is essential. Station should replace the
Webbrowser for work completely, so the (e.g.) LastPass Adon should work here.

Espacially when you give the Station Account to an employee they should have
no access to the passwords.

Hi all,

We started working on this tough subject a week ago with [@hugo](/u/hugo),
it’s among our top priorities. We still have a lot to figure out to make it
possible, but we won’t stop until we reach the objective.

For your information we work on the integration of:

   lastpass
   1password
   dashlane
   keepass

It’s still unsure if we’ll be able to integrate all of them and which one will
be the first supported.

We think we’ll able to let you test the integration before mid-January.

Another +1 for LastPass.

I’ve tried Station and have it installed, but its usefulness is very limited
for me without password integration. Particularly the Xero app logs me out
after just a few minutes and I have to copy both the username and password
across manually … so it’s still more efficient for me to do it in the browser.

You’ll have me back when the LastPass integration is working

Thanks!

Hi I was wondering about the ETA for password manager integrations. We (this
is not my company account) in the office have this really annoying problem
where every once in a while you get logged out by OneLogin (that’s our sso)
and when you sign back in we get thrown into this weird meta-page that’s
probably supposed to be a dashboard, but is not our gmail account.

As a result, we have to uncheck the gmail plugin and reenable it.

Previously the versions of station allowed us to double click to hard-refresh
the tab (which solved this). Whatever happened to that option?

Consider this another vote for 1Password. However, the existing integration
where I type in my credentials for Station to access/store is not considered
acceptable by me. While I trust the team at Station to deliver high quality

I still can’t see any other password manager than 1password in the current
roadmap.

Considering the amount of votes, this should be a priority.

If you don’t have time or can’t prioritize it yourself, I’m sure the password
managers can help or do it for you - considering that a competitor is
supported and not them

First of all, thank you for the reply.  
I am a Windows user (desktop) and Mac (laptop). And I use the Station in both.  
When I mentioned the minimize to the tray, it referred specialy to windows
users.  
Something like having in the preferences of the application an option to have
the application open but “hidden” in the tray (along the date / time).

I send an image as a suggestion and to understand what I mean.  
For example, the red ball would serve to show the user that there are new
notifications to see.

Hi Alexander,  
Here is my feedback as a Mac user.

When we close apps like Slack, Spotify or WhatsApp in Mac, the apps are not
“really” closed, it only minimizes. If you open it again, the app returns to
the original state you left. Currently when we close Station, the app is
really closed and we need to wait the pages to load again.

I’d definitely prefer some form of menu-bar integration for notifications
(macOS).

As to why I don’t use the dock notification - on a smaller screen Macbook I
don’t always have the dock visible as it takes up valuable space. But the
menu-bar is always there and doesn’t encroach on the main display area…

Actually even on my 27"" desktop Mac screen I don’t have the Dock showing. 99%
of the time the dock is just a reminder of apps I could open if I wanted to,
so I don’t need it visible all the time…especially with Alfred removing the
need for the dock anyway!

Station really needs a tray icon so that you can see if you have any
notifications with a small colored indicator. There is no way to see if you
have notifications without actually opening Station which is not a great user
experience. I saw a post on this from many months back and no one seems to
have properly addressed it. For a unified workplace browser, it requires a
better notification style in case you were away from your desk or not looking
at station to be able to see if there are any notifications

A quick message to thank you all for your feedback: we read every bug-report
and feature request posted here in the community and are still committed to
integrate [the most popular ones](https://community.getstation.com/top) to our
[product roadmap](https://roadmap.getstation.com/). Greatly [improving
Station’s performance](https://community.getstation.com/t/station-is-slow-
high-memory-usage-high-cpu-load/) and giving ability to [add any
URL](https://community.getstation.com/t/custom-url-support-support-any-web-
app/) was part of that continuous effort.

Also, we’ve been taking some time to rebuild Station’s technical foundations
to further reduce our time-to-market: this will hopefully allow us to ship
updates much faster than before.

Unfortunately, being a small team of 9, we don’t have enough resources to
answer to everyone and chose to prioritize product development at the expense
of reactivity. We understand that might be frustrating and wish to improve
on that matter, but we can’t really do much more at the moment.

Rest assured that we truly value customer feedback as it’s the single
source of truth for all our product decisions: some of the best features we
rolled out have started here in the community and we’ll never be grateful
enough for the user support we’re receiving.

Hope this will help alleviate your concerns.

I believe that this feature of minimize for the tray is something requested by
most of the users. It is a totally necessary feature in this type of tool,
which is available in all competitors. I really hope you find this a high

Just trying out Station again, and super happy the CPU usage issue is gone! So
this isn’t a deal breaker for me (the CPU issue was), but also really
surprised a tray icon isn’t implemented. Very simple in Electron, and I’m not
a dev by any stretch of the imagination, but is one of the first things you
learn to do when learning Electron.  
`const Tray = electron.Tray`  
`const iconPath = path.join(dirname, 'icon.png')`  
`app.on('ready', function(){new Tray(iconPath)})`  
Add that to your main.js and that’ll get you started

Add linux to the list. Rambox does this perfectly where the app stays in the
system tray at all times. If you close it, it remains running in the tray and
the tray icon lets you know if the apps/services in rambox have a notification

I would also like to see a tray Icon added. You lose many people to the
alternatives like Franz and Wavebox, because they have a tray icon. It is nice
that the program is able to start minimized and indicates new messages. I used
station some months ago and switched to the other alternatives because of the
tray icon. That is essential in todays times. It should be added to all
versions of station (Windows, MAC and Linux), with priority from my view for
Windows and Linux as I do not use MAC OS.

Am trying to replace Franz with Station. A couple of minor annoyances, which
may be easy to remedy (or not).

  1. Under Mint 19.2 Cinnamon the interface shows as a generic icon when on the taskbar. How do I change that behavior? Looks like the app image is launched at start as a startup item. Do I need to create a launcher, with the icon associated with the launcher, and then make the launcher be the one that starts?

  2. Is it possible to get a tray level indicator when new notifications come from one of the apps that Station is managing (e.g. Slack or FB Messenger). Best I can tell any notifications happen within Station only, not at an indicator level

  3. Is it possible to get notifications but without sound? if so, how?

I agree. The same goes for me in my job, though I’m not a freelancer/part-
timer (I’m a project/community manager at a university).

For me it would be best to have multiple views within Station on one account.
So I can group apps and set them up for the different tasks I’m doing during
the day/week. I’m working on multiple projects that have different needs and I
also have daily/weekly recurring other stuff to do. At the moment I have to
much apps in the dock and too much starred pages for everything. I only want
to see the apps and starred pages that have to do with the task/project that
I’m working on at that moment.

If I could for example at the top of the dock select a view for “Project A”,
“Project B”, “Task X”, et cetera, it would also provide some extra focus at
the work I’m doing.

For example when using Slack, having multiple accounts connected to your
current Station > Slack app doesn’t feel good and is directly hurting focus.

But as we are people, we still need multitasking, especially for people
working on multiple projects. What seems to me to be most in line with the
core philosophy of Station is thus to allow for multiple Stations
(properly named with the current project this Station is attached to). I would
imagine having each running full screen in a different desktop.

One station, one focus. Each project gets its proper share of focus.

In terms of implementing, this seems to be as simple as to allow for cmd+N.

Is there a way to setup multiple workspaces?

Let me give you my use case. I have my own business, but I also have a
strategic partnership with another organization. I use different GSuite apps
for both (e.g., Mail, Drive, Calendar) and I use different applications for
both (though there is some overlap). What I would like is to establish a
separate “dock” for both “work contexts” I’m operating in. It could really
just be two (or more) “views” onto the same dock.

Regardless of how it’s implemented, does this type of feature exist, or is it
planned to exist in the future?

This, plus [Custom URL Support](https://community.getstation.com/t/custom-url-

I’m a web developer and I have 1 business running on Google Apps, but I also
have a few projects on Google Apps as well. It would be great if I could
switch between Instance 1 (my business), Instance 2 (a Non-Profit I’m the
treasurer for), etc. and have my gmail, calendar, drive, etc. to follow which
instance i’m in.

The Custom URL is because my work is Wordpress web development, so often times
I’m in Google Docs (my notes), as well as Email and Zendesk while working
inside of a site… and while I’m working in a site, I could easily have 10+
tabs open.

This would allow us to cleanly separate between the different personas we each
wield in our daily life. Also, I think it could help further positively
distinguish working in Station versus the browser. I think this easily could
be something that would be part of a monetized part of the platform. Offering
one profile for free, multiple for a monthly fee.

between for different clients or projects (not just instances of apps). I have
a 9-5 job and a freelance business. I’d love to be able to open all the apps I
need for my 9-5 and then when I’m working on my side gig, just switch user
icons, closing all those apps, and opening all the ones I need for my side gig
gig. Perhaps when a user clicks their user icon on the bottom left, provide an
option to add or switch to another Gmail account (without logging out of the
other).

 SUMMARY (your need in one sentence)

As a probable human I want to be able to split Station into multiple dockable
windows so that I can cleanly divide by “personal” and “work”, without having
a pile of windows that I have to manage.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT (how would it change your experience)

The main advantages for me are:  
I could easily switch between work and personal modes, without having to
manually arrange windows. This essentially allows multiple “workspaces” with
different purposes.

It actually could be really nice for folks who work across multiple
teams/Slack groups (e.g., contractors) even outside of the work/personal
divide…

Couldn’t agree more with this statement. I have tried Station, but left it
because it lacked this functionality. As a freelancer / developer you have a
lot of projects going on. All have another slack workspace, gmail, google
calendar, google sheets etc. etc.

Multi-account Google Chrome is the way I’m dealing with it now as well. But
Station would definitely be the killer app if it supports this functionality!

Same thing here. I have a professional account, a freelance account and a
personal acount, then there are the projects one works on. Grouping apps into
workspaces would be wonderfull, keeping others from a different workspace
‘alive’ all the time.  
Wonderful product, came here after I found [wavebox.io](http://wavebox.io)
that has this ‘kind of’ feature.  
Kudos!

First & foremost, way to go for getting Station together and getting it to
Market. As a new-comer, I was blown away by the overall concept. It’s exactly
what I’ve been looking for. And I was SO excited to get into it.

However, sadly not having this feature request (in addition to not yet
including Google Chrome) makes it nearly unusable, or at most minimally
usable, perhaps for only one of hundreds of things we are tasked with at a
time in this day & age.

I am a Miro-Business Consultant who has partnered with colleagues in business,
and often has many short-term as well as long-term client projects all at
once, as well as managing my own business projects (each encompassing multiple
stages, with varied lists of tasks), and coaching/managing/organizing a soccer
club on the side. So the ability to have especially separate Profiles,
possibly Workspaces, & even Instances is essential to business organizational
survival.

It actually seems there should be just that, multiple Profiles >> Workspaces
>> Instances in just such a hierarchy. Having separate Profiles would very
clearly allow the separation of proprietary roles, while multiple Workspaces
would allow for different type- / short- / long-term projects, & finally
variable instances would allow for on-the-fly, quick-switching between
necessary comparison / reference sources.

So just to add my 2-sense as well as voice a little wishful thinking outloud,
including this feature (as well as Google Chrome ;-), would without a doubt
put Station on top of just about any organizational / productivity / resource
application / program available today.

As the saying goes, “build it and they will come”.

Hi team,

I’m a Linux/Windows user, I work in two different companies and I could use
Station for personal purposes too. For each of these 3 contexts, I need
different applications and/or accounts, but as a nomad user I use the same
computer for these 3 contexts.

Is there any way to have a multi-context configuration of Station? If yes, how
do I set it and how do I switch between them?

Maybe, can I try to “Dockerize” Station for now to keep each of my context
configuration separated from others? And then, I rely on my OS to switch
between Station “context specialized” instances? Could it work?

Many thanks,

Tongtwist

I would LOVE this and would gladly pay for a premium product to be able to do
this. It would make working on multiple monitors super efficient.

Until then, I’m just launching another app instance so it’s running twice.
This helps a little bit.

Anyone else wanting to know how to do this, I just duplicated the app in mac’s
Applications finder window and named it Station2.app so when I switch between
them via the dock. I see “Station” and “Station2” and can launch them from
there.

I love Station’s UI a lot but I have rarely been using Station for the past
few months because Rambox Pro has something very important and useful that
Station doesn’t. It has the ability to separate work, personal and project
based profiles and ability to completely turn off certain profiles. This saves
up huge RAM and it’s extremely efficient. If Station had similar feature,
which is super crucial for productivity, I would recommend it to everyone.
Station has beautiful UI but this specific lack of feature led me to Rambox
Pro .

I hope you will make this a top priority.

I have to chime in too. I’m a student at a local university near me and I’d
really love to use this but have personal and school separated. Having a app
like this and finding a way to have a second monitor seems key to my success…I
honestly can put most of my major desktop apps or tabs in here and consolidate
things tremendously. There’s just too much that I use that I can’t not have
this since I use about 15 different things that this app supports
consolidating. Having say a button for this that organizes by email used would
be helpful. Having it all together is…strange when each account/email may be
for a different purpose and help focusing for where one is at that moment.

+1 and giant Yes Please!! This is an important feature for business users. You
can separate your personal and business apps or group them by client.

Rambox has a similar feature called Groups that allows you to group apps.
Another Station competitor is building this and calls it Profiles. The
functionality is the same. Segment apps into groups so you can access them by
clicking on the segment icon in the menu and all notifications can be managed
at the segment level.

Hope you take and build this feature request.

SUMMARY

It would be nice to have “profiles” inside station

GIVE US CONTEXT

As a part time student, part time developer and part time creator, it would be
awesome if I could have “profiles” inside station, so for instance if I’m at
work I could active my “work profile” and only have selected apps related to
my work and when I’m hom I could active my “home profile” and have other apps
that I use only for talking to friends.

PROVIDE DETAILS

I’d like to be able to create different profiles inside station and select
which apps and accounts I would add to each profile. Then, when I am using
station I could select which profile is active, so that I only see the
profile’s app and only receive notification from these apps.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT

Actually I know this feature would not be game changing, but I believe it
would make me more productive at work. I like receiving messengers
notifications when I’m home, but when I’m working if I receive a notification
and simply ignore it, I get really anxious haha.

One quick “fix” achieve multiple-instance: install Station on multiple
computers, and remote-access the computers

I am 3-days into using Station, and have already been longing for the multi-
profile support for 90% of the time. For people with multiple computers to
work with, I personally think the “fix” is not that bad an idea:

   There are multiple ways to establish remote-access to other computers within seconds;
   When working with one computer, it is doable to write script to quickly (< 1 second) switch from the local machine to the remote machine, and then get back;
   It may help de-clutter the mind: 
     Unless the machines are running totally headlessly, its physical location will provide all environmental nudges that can help one to concentrate on the specific task.
     Historically, I was doing the opposite by duplicating all settings on all machines, and making all files available or in sync across all machines. This turns out to be very time-consuming, and actually did not add too much value to my life.

I agree that being able to have several work-spaces in order to separate out
apps is a good thing. I have three different emails (one personal/business and
two business emails) and would love to have a work-space for my personal apps
and separate work-spaces for business 1 and business 2. This feature would
help me to stay more focused.

We’ve been working hard to release a new feature called workspaces : those
are spaces in which you can drop any link across any application (spreadsheet,
tasks, documents, notes) to get back to it later and share it with your team.
I think this might solve many of the use cases mentioned in this thread.
Little teaser of what it looks like below

Are you logged into Station with your work email? This feature so far is in
private Beta and only works for users logged in with a work email. If you’d

I need Workspaces SOOOOO much. [Station.io](http://Station.io) looks great but
without the Franz style workspace of being able to declutter, it is just too
many tabs and disorganised. Which is the whole point of trying to use it: to
make it LESS tabs boggling your brain and taking up space.

I want the workspaces to be like Franz in that you can simply click and it
changes to only show the vital ones you need. I also want to be able to see
the text of what it is, not just the icon. Please please please implement it
like they do. I keep going back to Franz instead but it’s too slow, so at the
moment I just feel stuck and disorganised, wishing I could make it clearer and
faster. I cannot be alone in this, adding this feature is vital.

Hi!  
How can I set a Night mode in Telegram like in desktop version:

It will be great if a possible use color setting for all apps. For example, if
change dark/night mode in Station this applies to all apps. Maybe use Stylish
for it.

Dark Mode in Station

I have a full time Digital Marketer and I also do some freelance stuff as a
side hustle. So, I put tin long hours before my laptop, especially station.

Currently, long time usage is a little uneasy on the eyes. Would love to see a
dark mode version which will be easy on my eyes and vision.

+1 for this.

In 2018 it’s almost a bug report “I can’t find the dark mode option”.  .

With IDEs, SQL tools, API tools, mobile apps like Twitter & many others, even
Apple implementing optional dark mode in macOS (on top of what’s already
there) - this is a must-have.

Thanks

While it is not convenient or what I’d consider a long-term-viable fix, the
fact that Station gives access to View -> Developer -> Toggle Page Developer
Tools does mean it’s possible to inject custom styles from the console. At
least, I have that working for my dark Slack theme.

However, since I haven’t figured out a way to splice it into Station itself
somewhere, I have to do it every time I start Station for every instance of
every app I want to do it for. I just thought I’d mention it as something to
explore for anyone else coming across this ticket who considers it worth the
effort. If anyone can work out where Station might have a file we could edit
to splice in a DOMContentLoaded event listener to an app as it’s being fired
up (and how to tell which app it is), that might get us at least to the same
level of convenience as loading a custom theme in the Slack desktop app.

Stylish support, or any kind of built-in setup for custom scripts or styles,
would certainly still be a better long-term solution.

Since this browser positioned for all-in-one web apps which sometimes is used
at the night.  
I suggest to add an extension to color webapps into dark color scheme which is
more comfortable to use when you’re in a room with low light.

At least it’s easy to add a button/setting to invert colors of an app and will
highly improve user experience.

I see it as scheduled switch or by button press.

I like Station so far, but I don’t use apps anymore that won’t support a dark

mode.

This has to happen. Was excited to use Station after trying the competitors
but without dark mode I can’t do it.

I don’t even need true dark mode or a whole lot of customization but at least
allow the apps to use their different native theme settings.

Like Slack, for instance. When I change themes it only changes the sidebar and
not the conversation window. Bummer.

yes, one of their “apps” is called “any website” and you just put in the url
you want.

If I understand correctly, it’s essentially just a bookmark for a browser page

so it will keep you logged in and it (should) save your place, if you choose.

Hi:  
I do believe we need to look at the resource requirements and how that
integrates into the long term plans of Station. I get the need for custom
urls. https only. Of course we love it! Of course we want everything. I am
amazed at what has been done so far. Pre-determined connections give more
predictability for resource usage. Security is another concern. I believe they
will work things in according to the plan. Just my thoughts. Thanks for

I’m not sure how this app launched without this. If it’s because there was
concern some sites might crash the app, it could’ve been added with a warning
to users that customers URLs are unsupported (ie. if it doesn’t work, its on

Yes, this would be a useful feature. If adding a non-supported web app or web
site a warning could appear saying it isn’t necessarily supported, but
advanced users might want to do this anyway, especially for web apps they
might have developed which specifically fit-in with Station’s purpose.

Personally seeing  
""Does your team need internal applications in Station? Request an internal
app""  
1- makes me psychologically feel bad because I get the feeling I’m relaying
extra work to someone else (the Station team)  
2- leaves me with the feeling that I might spend time submitting an app and
that you won’t consider it, meaning I have wasted my time.

So you forgot those options on the poll.

Why don’t you allow for custom URL support, and then analyse the amount of
custom URLs added to station and decide to create or not apps from them on
basis of quantity?

Love the the app, but I wanted to provide some feedback on a particular use
case I’d have where it possible:

Most of our business apps are now web based, a mixture of SaaS and internal
web apps. While I can submit a request for the SaaS ones to be added, I’d love
to be able to add internal apps just for my station instance. Then I can roll
the app out to company desktops and have ALL their work apps in one interface.

Hi [@BrianGilbert](/u/briangilbert)

Thanks for your feedback! If you want to add your self hosted Gitlab or any
custom URL, you can request an app in the App Store (the “+” button on the
bottom right).  
You’ll have the ability to request a private app (only visible to you),
company app (your case, visible to your team - based on the email domain) or
public (visible to anyone). Requested apps are made available within two
weeks.

We should make this clearer for self hosted apps that are already on Station.

Since Station v1.24, we revamped the custom apps request process with the main
change being that we’re now committed to adding the apps you request within
a maximum of 2 weeks. Just [hit the + button](https://cl.ly/7ee69b) in the
bottom left corner of Station’s app store and get those requests out!

  

This is not perfectly satisfying and our goal is still to provide an
instantaneous “Add your custom app” feature. Here’s a bit of background about
why this still needs to take some time.

The “custom-app request feature” has 3 underlying use-cases:

   I need a public app that’s not supported yet but should be made available to all Station’s users  
Examples: Spotify or Facebook

   I need a company-specific app that needs to be made available to all my colleagues using Station  
Examples: self-hosted GitHub, JIRA, RocketChat, HipChat, Gitlab, Jenkins
instances

   I need a private app that is really specific to me or my team

The complexity here is that every use-case comes with its own challenges and
requirements:

   Public apps need to be thoroughly tested before release to the whole user-base : can the user log-in? Do notifications work? Do we need an integration with the Quick Switch? Shall we keep the app constantly awake? Is there a universal login URL or is a subdomain needed? Does the app run on the outdated Chrome version embedded in Electron? What is the app’s category in the app store?

   Company-specific apps don’t need as much testing but still need an icon (in the right .svg format), a name and a URL with a proper updating flow. Plus they need to automatically appear in the app-store of users with a specific domain without introducing any security breach

   …

Don’t hesitate to give us feedback on the new flow we introduced: if you
complete its 3 simple steps, the app you requested will appear in your
Station’s app store within a couple of days and you’ll be notified by email!

Glad to hear that you guys are working on it. Only i don’t get why you guys
aren’t adding private custom apps first. Public and Team custom apps are
probably not the biggest concern for everyone who’s waiting for custom apps.
So far i understand it’s not that hard to implement this first. Correct me if
I’m wrong.

But thanks for improving for now

Hi,

I would like to suggest, that you just implement the Custom URL (Really Custom
only private case) first.  
As your app is using the chrome browser engine and all Apps are just
interfaces for tabs, you just need  
an basic interface or just a tab for a custom URL.  
You would not need to adjust anything, just call the Base URL, which was set
up and then just configure  
to open any link in the same tab instead opening the standard Browser or
handling a new tab.

As I saw in your other apps, you already have this functionality and also
basically the function to add sub URLs as favorites. So you would just need to
add anything you already implemented without any specific configuration.

If there is an other reason than written above, you should tell the community.  
For example and perhaps, you get payed by companies for implementing their
apps and if you would allow custom URL’s no one would be forced to use in
first case the given apps. For this case you could parse the custom urls and
Check if the base URL is already in a list of existing apps (with regex) and
would force the user then to checkout the already existing app.

It will take your time to always evaluate the custom URL requests like you
suggested and also what if I want to use this app on different devices? Do I
have to request for all devices separately and what if I want to share in my
company? Do I have to request again?

I know this tool is for free and somewhere you have to earn your money, but
however the income is planned, the reasons you wrote above are not reliable at
all for me.

The Flow you suggest here has one Problem: I would like to suggest this app
for our company, but when I wont be able to check if anything works as planned
I can’t and then I have to suggest apps like Franz or Rambox as they are able
to do what we need here. The thing is that your app is more comfortable as its
designed very nice and has a much better Layout.

What you could do to have an income anyway, you could add the custom URL and
offer a payed plan for example for 5€ / month for companies to have a
synchronization for teammates.

Company Account has base apps which will be added to all related employee
accounts and the employees can add additionally own apps which wont be
synchronized for the whole team.

What would be the benefit for companies?  
When there is a fluctuation, new teammates would have an easy way to get an
onboarding for example.  
This would save a lot of time for many companies.

And for 5€ more any company would have the ability to add Chrome Browser
extensions for example.  
And a lot would do … Why because u can use JIRA or Office for example and
there are extensions to add snippets for example so it would improve the
effectivity for some.

And so on… There are a lot of ideas on how to earn money easily with this Base
but without a custom URL it is really not very usefull. Either I want to
centralize all standard websites I use every day or I don’t need.  
Why should I centralize some and have the rest again in my default browser ?
Then I have to switch anyways.

Please don’t read this like I would like to say you don’t know what you are
doing, read it more like:  
You did a great job and have a lot of decisions to make and perhaps you never
thought about arguments like these ones and perhaps you see it like me after
you got some new arguments as input.

Thanks for your attention and I will request custom apps like you suggested
above, but please think about it again to change.

This has been the top feature request for more than a year now. Not sure
what’s holding them back to integrate this rather simple request. I can
understand that some apps need special treatment but most URLs users want to
implement are very simple web sites which shouldn’t be so hard to support. At
least start with the implementation and give us something simple which works
with the majority of web sites. All the edge cases can be handled once we get
some experience with that.

Brief description of the issue

I can’t seem to specify a Phabricator instance URL. You can add multiple
instances, and there’s a “when available, use instance logo in dock” option,
but “add a new instance” just makes another instance with the default public
Phabricator URL.

I have a self-hosted instance, but even with their paid service you’ll need to
specify a different URL. Am I missing something obvious, or did this setting
get paved under at some point? Looks like it’s been a few versions since it
was added.

SUMMARY  
Your need in one sentence

Add support for Plutio’s white label option

GIVE US CONTEXT  
Tell us about the current experience

Plutio’s white label option allows the use of custom domain. This is used with
all the URLs. But Station uses Plutio’s domain, so whenever we need
sharing/public links that Plutio generates they use Plutio’s domain instead of
our custom domain.

PROVIDE DETAILS  
Tell us what you are looking to change

Provide an option in Plutio app’s settings to specify custom domain (text
input). Plutio will handle the rest.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT  
How would it change your experience

The main advantages for me are:

   Plutio pages will open in browser with correct custom domain

My problem is that …

I can’t figure out how to add a self-hosted Bitbucket, JIRA, or OWA Exchange
server. There are no options to supply the Bitbucket location. There is no
option to search for OWA Exchange server.

I looked all over the FAQ, <https://faq.getstation.com/> \- and either I’m not

To switch to a custom URL for an app (as a workaround at the moment)

   Add an app of the type you want to use a custom URL for to your Station app.
   While setting up that app, open up the Station Page Developer Tools
   Click the Console option
   Type in location.href = “<https://my.custom.url>” (for whatever your URL is)
   Hit Enter

That should reload the page to point to your custom URL using that app’s

Again - this is not an official way to do things and could change at any
point. As of this date, it seems to work (at least for rocket.chat).

I can only “Add a new instance” of each app, which merely creates a duplicate,
rather than a separate account. If I logout of an account on one instance, it
logs out all other instances (e.g. 2 Twitter instances: 1 personal account, 1
company account).

“Add another account” is not an option in Windows. Is this feature coming to

This is a huge selling point for apps like Station for me; I have switched to
Station from [Shift](http://tryshift.com) because Station has a much nicer UI,
a wider selection of apps, and many other features I like better, but Shift
enabled me to manage multiple social media accounts in one app. Supporting
this in Station would be a huge deal.

Brief description of the issue

I have 3 numbers that I have 3 separate WhatsApp accounts on (personal,
official and freelance). These are active across an iPhone and a dual-sim
Android device.

However, Station seems to prevent me from logging in to more than one WhatsApp
account. When creating multiple instances of WhatsApp, each instance does not
seem to be isolated in an individual sandbox.

Due to this, as soon as one or more new instances are created, WhatsApp shows
a ‘WhatsApp is open in another window’ with options ‘Use here’ or ‘Close’ on
all but one instance. Thus I’m never able to login on WhatsApp Web for more
than one number/account.

Ideally, an instance of WhatsApp web should be completely unaware of another
letting users login multiple times in parallel.

At the very least you should disable the “add new account” button for apps
that don’t support it. It’s really not a good UX to let people try it, report
a bug, only to get their report merged with an old feature request.

If you can’t support this for now, make it obvious, disable “add new account”,
and/or write some explanation about this limitation when user tries to so it.

Buffer is, for me, one of the best Social Media multi account posting utility

SUMMARY  
Your need in one sentence

As an owner of multiple accounts in different services (MS Teams, O365, etc…)
I want to have multiple account available for a given app so that I can switch
from onre to the other seamlessly.  
GIVE US CONTEXT  
Tell us about the current experience

Today, only a fistful of apps get this privilege while major services (Teams,
Outlook) don’t.  
However, it’s rather current to have multiple mailbox or multiple teams to
work with.

PROVIDE DETAILS  
Tell us what you are looking to change

I’d like most common apps to be able to have multiple accounts possibility

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT  
How would it change your experience

The main advantages for me are:

   working seamlessly with one customers and jumpint to one another easily

Brief description of the issue

When I open two instances of the hangout when I log in to the second, the
first one gets the same account as the second.

In other words, I can not have two instances open at the same time.

Does anyone confirm this problem? Or is it some part of my setup that is
wrong.

Hi Guys!

I need to join the speakers to those who commented before me…I think the
most important feature request is the  Instance separation. Every
competing app like Shift, Wavebox working good, and separating instances for
Facebook, Instagram, Messenger etc… One tab, one new instance… We very like
the Station App because some things much better than on Shift or Wavebox but
now we can’t always use it because of this deficiency. When this feature come
we switch to Station App finnally!

Ver good and nice app! Go forward! Thank you guys!

Definitely, we agree! Station needs a Linux version.

To give some technical context behind this (provided by [@joel](/u/joel)):
yes, it’s simple to build an electron app for Linux. However it’s more
difficult to keep it up to date.  
Indeed, on Mac and Windows, electron has an auto-update system that makes easy
to release and distribute new versions. On Linux, there is no such system: one
needs to publish it on package managers. [snaps](https://snapcraft.io/) seem
to be a solution.

We have not dug enough into it yet and we don’t make it a high prio now, but I
guess we might sort things out for the beginning of next year.

It’ll come!

love to use Station on both my Ubuntu workstation and various Pi 3’s as

30 seconds.) Thanks!

Why not have manual updates on Linux for now? You could simply release
packages for major distributions.  
This is what I do for my product and it only takes running electron-builder
and uploading to S3. Works good enough for the users. The majority of active
ones update quickly.

Updating only takes one command depending on the distribution.

I can provide more details regarding the build process, update notifications,
or show how it works if you are interested.

Hi

I might repeat what a few person said above me, but I guess most of Linux
users wont be bothered by having to download and build manually the new
version to update the software  
As a person who daily uses a windows, osx and ubuntu os, I’m really
disappointed to have to use an alternative to Station when I’m on linux, that
doesn’t perfectly fit what I expect from this kind of software.  
So I know this request has been tagged “later”, but I hope you wont wait for
all linux distros to implement a native auto-update system to deploy your
software on these platforms

Station look like such an awesome tool for the average developer it almost

Like others have stated about a zip, even if you host it publicly behind a
/nightly-builds/, /current-build/, whatever sort of URL, someone will write a
script to pull it or compare to latest for updating themselves. That would
silence the general community rumble w/o costing many resources figuring out
the package managers across multiple distros etc.

Check out how oh-my-zsh does it for an example ->
<https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh> A simple curl pumped to sh. It
checks for updates with a configurable override, I think it defaults to every
wk. Configs and scripts don’t scare us

Jumping on the bandwagon!

It’s been almost a years since we’ve had a response. I think it’s in-line with
a little status update at least

[@Alexandre](/u/alexandre) If the auto-updates are the only thing that’s
stopping you from releasing I strongly encourage you to just release a build
for Linux. Rolling-distributions like arch update their systems regularly
anyways and have no expectation of an auto-update feature. And more stable
distributions will be more than happy with a static version as long as their
productivity increases.

Lastly, speaking of Arch I can make a package in the AUR and hopefully get it
promoted to [community] as soon as you release a build and I can help you with
making a snap if you interested.

In short. Just release a build for Linux and please respond/ contact me

I actually came here to speak on this. I have several slack teams I am apart
of and each have only the default slack icon associated with it. I have to
click on each to see what team it is. It would be great if the actual team
logo was maintained.

Here is what my sidebar looks like:

yeah, this is sorta brutal and probably my biggest frustration with station.

BUT, it looks like you guys have already solved it on the “teammates sidebar”…
would love to see the same sort of UX on the actual left hand sidebar that
get’s used by everyone 24/7. Group all teams into one sidebar menu item, and
leverage the team logos for each so you can quickly toggle between appropriate
groups.

 SUMMARY

The various Slack teams all appear in the left panel with the same Slack icon.

Currently all of the teams have the Slack logo as their icon and it is
inconvenient to have to select each one to find the desired team.

I’d like to have the logos of the individual Slack teams show up in the app
bar on the left.

This would allow users to efficiently find the desired Slack team.

I did have the workspace logo next to the slack icon (which is fine for me),
but since the huge mess introduced in v1.11, I had to clear all my apps and
start over from scratch (I must love station to do that!). Now the workspace
logo has disapeared. Can you please fix that.

I have several Slack rooms that I would like to add but only 2 in Station
right now. Currently Slack shows its logo for the identifier in the sidebar.
This makes differentiating between multiple Slack groups difficult. I believe
that changing this to the group image would visually discern which group is
which and improve the UX drastically. Thoughts?

I am so happy that this feature was added. I do love that the icon is now full
sized, but the icons appear very faded when inactive and can be hard to
quickly tell apart.

I’d suggest either driving the contrast up as high as the other app icons
(make the lightest color as white as the outline on the gmail icon), OR show
the icons actual colors; faded when inactive and full color when active.

Right now downloads will be saved in your systems default downloads folder.

On Windows it’s here: C:\Users[Your user name]\Downloads  
On macOS it’s here: [Your Hard Drive] → Users → [Your user name] → Downloads

Maybe this is something they will implement in the future. So this thread
could be moved over to the feature requests.

One more vote for this—my sense is that a large number of people just do not
use the system’s default Downloads folder.

It would be helpful at least if the notification for finished downloads had an

Hi Georges,

I do not believe that this feature has been implemented as described in the
original feature request. We would like the option to select the download
location every time we download a file. Every time we hit download in
gmail we want to get to choose where this file ends up. In gmail in the
browser the Save As diaglog pops up ⇒ this is the desired behaviour. What
you have implemented is letting us choose one folder where all downloads
end up.

That’s definitely an issue we realized and we are looking for solutions but
have not settled yet.

Could you help us a bit by detailing your use-cases:

   What are the 19 apps you are using? Are you using all of them everyday, every 2 days, etc…?
   For example how often are you using Tweetdeck, Facebook, Buffer?
   What folders would you imagine in your case?
   Why would you need an overview of all your apps? In which situation? and what will you do with an overview?

As a side note, some users use frequently the search shortcut (`Cmd+T`) in
this case to switch between apps. For instance: `Cmd+T` and type `trel => you
are on Trello. It’s a very productive habit! It might help if you don’t know
it.

Most I use everyday, but not all of them. Tweetdeck, Facebook, Buffer I use
most of the days, but not all the day. Others like Calendar, Basecamp, Drive,
Contacts, Evernote, Todoist I use every day the whole day.

Here in the conversation below this post I say something about what would be
ideal for me. It’s a bit further than just grouping apps: [Multiple Instances
of Station (For employees & part-
timers)](https://community.getstation.com/t/multiple-instances-of-station-for-
employees-part-timers/191/2?u=denniskuscu)

It comes down to grouping based on tasks. I would imagine a folder/instance
like “Doing administration for event X”, and in that group I would have:

   SurveyGizmo
   Google Drive - page with spreadsheet overview of all events
   Google Drive - page with spreadsheet registrations for events
   Salesforce
   Basecamp - page with to-do’s for this event
   Basecamp - page with internal communication for this event

Another folder/instance would be “Social Media”, there I would have:

   Facebook - our Facebookpage
   Facebook - Facebookgroup A
   Facebook - Facebookgroup B
   Facebook - Facebookgroup C
   Tweetdeck
   Twitter - my own profile
   LinkedIn - group of peers
   LinkedIn - page of our university
   Salesforce

Another folder/instance would be “Doing administration for service Z”, there I
would have:

   Outlook - folder with e-mails coming in about service Z
   Google Drive - page with spreadsheet overview of service Z
   Google Drive - page with students currently using service Z
   Basecamp - page with information about service Z
   Salesforce - page with contacts

This way I would make groups/instances that combine all the relevant
apps/pages for a certain task that I need to do. And also have the same app
multiples times across the different tasks/instances. For me it’s not useful
to group every for example Google Drive page in “Google Drive”, like it is
now.

If I could have a group/instance for every task/thing I need a different
configuration for, I can easily and quickly switch and have all my apps and
pages ready to go.

An overview of all my apps is not necessarily needed. For me it would be nice
to have an overview of all the tasks here in Station. I switch from task to
task (and project to project) during a day. It’s not like that on monday I’m
working on this, on tuesday I’m working on that. At all time we have a lot of
projects and events and other things going, and we are switching between all
of that depending on deadlines, calls/mails/communication coming in, etc.

Could some admin merge this kind of feature request in one topic only ? I saw
that we’ve got around 5 or six topics with the same end.

SUMMARY (your need in one sentence)

As a user of hundreds of web apps, I want to group apps on the sidebar in a
visual manner.

GIVE US CONTEXT (tell us about the current experience)

Station shows a sidebar with all added apps at once which difficult working
with only a few apps at a time. For example, sometimes i’m involved in
webdesign activities that needs only a set of tools and i can’t filter to only
display a custom subset of tools, losing time searching among the list and
visually not seeing the right icons.

PROVIDE DETAILS (tell us what you are looking to change)

Either group through some custom tagging or folder system (Operations,
Marketing, whatever-the-user-wants) like Gmail folders or Starring only
certain apps to show up (Slack has a good system for this).  
Using attributing tags to each app would be a nice solution letting each app
to be shown when the tag is filtered and displaying multiple apps across
different categories.  
It would be also good to have a put to sleep feature where user can choose to
only tagged apps remains active.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT (how would it change your experience)

It would save a lot of time during work and increase the overall gain of
productivity with the tool.

 SUMMARY

Be able to create groups of apps so that they would work as directories in
which one would navigate to. The current nav bar would be replaced with groups
and one could switch between them or navigate/select a specific app of the
other group to check it out.

GIVE US CONTEXT

I have several apps in which there are 2 versions, one personal and the other
one for work, with this the navigation bar gets so long that navigating
between them and finding the work app is sometimes troublesome, because the
life apps could share the same icon. What I would love is basically a way to
separate life apps from work apps.

PROVIDE DETAILS

I believe changing the nav bar as to only see groups would be a quicker way to
navigate.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT

This would help me quickly switch between my work apps instead of getting
confused with the same icons for my life app instances.

I love the software, great job guys but I think there is one thing that could
be changed. I would love to see the ability to group several app instances
under a single app icon, then when you hover over the app you can switch
between the instances and see the notifications for each when hovering.

This would be good as it would keep the initial app bar minimal and just give
the user the ability to hover over to switch between different instances. In
my use case I have multiple clients so have multiple gmail and slack instances
- which clogs up the app list because they are listed separately. If they
could be grouped into a single app icon so when I hover over I can see how
many notifications there are and switch between instances I think this would
be a better user experience.

Thanks,

# Summary -

I would like the ability to group my apps together like I can on my iPhone. I
want to group my Google Apps in a Google group/folder on the sidebar.

## Why?

The sidebar is nice but it’s essentially useless if you have a 10+ apps for
your workstation since there’s going to be lots of scrolling, dragging, and
hovering involved. I don’t even use my sidebar anymore, I just use CMD-T so I
can at least look at the disorganized bundle.

It may be a little OCD but I like to be able to group my apps by their
intended purpose/category/provider so that I’m not looking at 20 scattered
apps over a toolbar.

At least let me group all the Google apps.

## Advantages:

I use station a lot less than I know I would if this issue were solved.
Currently due to this I only ever come on here for one or two apps at most,
preferring to use my browser the remainder of the time.

If this were resolved, I’d be a full-time user.

# Example of what I am referring to when I say ‘Grouping’

Have you considered a feature where on the main screen applications can be
grouped into groups/Themes/Sub Headings like Comms, Online Files, Social
Media, CRM

We all are starting to use many applications so remembering them all is
starting to be a challenge so it would be great if you could put them in
groups/folders like we do on our IPhones/Desktops.

You could still have direct applications links for the top 10 applications
used.

You could make it a little like a single sign on system like JumpCloud

The main advantages for me are:

   easy to find what you are looking for

   Don’t have to remember all the names

   Can organise applications into Folders that make sense for you

Hi. Thank you for your app. I got an email with a description that station
groups pages by the app. I added a lot of slack workspaces and they didn’t
group. It’s not very convenient to scroll tab bar

I’m involved with 4 different companies in various ways (consultant, advisor,
founder, etc) and grouping per company or project would be invaluable. I agree
with most things said here so far, but have a couple comments:

  1. Allow users to add a small divider line or gap between apps in the Smart Dock. This would provide visual separation between sets of apps. This should be an easy thing to implement and could be introduced before completing the grouping or folders feature. Bonus points if the divider could have a label.

  2. Add support for “groups” to be able to be expanded/collapsed and show the expanded apps easily accessible within the Smart Dock like they are today. I’m not a big fan of accordions, but something similar could work. I would prefer that a second level dock not be added, the apps would still stay in the same vertical dock space just within collapsible sections.

What I don’t want is for it to require more mousing and clicking to open
folders every time I want to access an app. It would be better if I could
expand the group I’m currently working with, showing those apps in the Smart
Dock. Apps in other groups would be hidden, but the divider/label would be
visible.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that I can’t see the Slack Team selector left bar I normally see
when using Slack.  
When I add another team it just shows up in the Station app icon list. Having
many Slack teams I don’t want that. I just want one Slack App Icon and when I
select the Slack app, I also want the Slack team list inside that window.

I am having the same/similar problem. Station does not seem to be properly
grouping the slack apps together into a single icon in the sidebar; it creates
a new slack icon for every instance.

SUMMARY  
Group all your sidebar badges by type, instead of multiple Gmail / Drive /
Calendar icons filling the sidebar if you have more than one account for the
same app.

I have 3 different Gmail accounts, work, personal, freelancing, and each has a
Drive, a Calendar, a Google Photos account etc etc. This means that other
unique apps get pushed down the listunder 3 versions of each of these app
badges.

I would prefer to have multiple accounts in the same app groupable into one
single badge.

Perhaps a hover-over function would display the different account options
under the app badge, showing profile photos for each account, with
notification dots / notification numbers for each when expanded. When the
badge is not hovered, it would show totals for all the accounts.

GIVE US CONTEXT  
Would free-up a lot of space in the side bar to fit a greater number of unique
apps. At present, if I’m playing music from the soundcloud app and want to
pause, i have to scroll down and search for the soundcloud app under a stack
of duplicated app types.

We naturally start with why (based on a need, a feature, a client project, a
task, to get that thing to the next step), while today, Station starts with
what (you open the Google Sheet app tab, then your client’s sheet ; and your
favorite CRM tab, then your client’s tab).

The need is to have one tab for this feature, one tab for this project, one
tab for just the design of this more complex project, one tab for this new
side project, one tab for this client, one tab for this special partnership,
one tab for this event.  
In each tab you would open the apps you generally need each time you work on
this project, like your Slite, your CRM, your 2 google sheets, your Slack,
your UpWork, open with the good companies / channels / pages.  
And what’s “One App To Rule Them All” if you can’t start a new project in just
a few clicks. For instance, starting the promotion for your next event just
requires a new “event promo” tab, with MeetUp, sales navigator, fb ads,
mailchimp, and 2 google sheets. With the right default options (name,
colleagues in edit mode, integrations) for each.

I hope to see that one day in the app that will rule them all, taking business
workflows to the next level.

I have multiple accounts for Google Drive/Discord/etc. It doesn’t seem
efficient that each instance per service needs its own “circle” icon on the
left sidebar. It would be great if instead, the services were grouped
together. For example, Google Drive would have only 1 icon on the left
sidebar, and once you hover over it, you can choose which account to use.

We’ve been working hard to release a new feature called workspaces : those
are spaces in which you can drop any link across any application (spreadsheet,
tasks, documents, notes) to get back to it later and share it with your team.
I think this might solve many of the use cases mentioned in this thread.
Little teaser of what it looks like below

Are you logged into Station with your work email? This feature so far is in
private Beta and only works for users logged in with a work email. If you’d
like to give it a try and join our private Beta, let me know! I’ll activate
the feature for you right away.

This is a huge thing for me trying to move from Franz or Rambox. And could be
easily done without running your own infrastructure and backend to do it. Just
use Google Drive, Dropbox, Onedrive, or the many storage solutions, and save
the data there, and pull it from there.

️ After I’ve been logged out from station, I can’t log back in

After the latest update (1.21.0), I have been logged out from Station. When I
open the Station app, it asks me to log in with a google account. I log in
into a google account which is already associated with a Station account, but
station doesn’t recognise it and asks me to configure all the apps as if I
just created this account. I can’t get all my apps back and would need to
configure them all again. I’ve stopped using station for now until there is a
fix.

  

️ Mandatory details

   Trigger — Unknown. App update? Cleaning app data from disk? Maybe CleanMyMac app removed some data from my disk? But my account and apps associated with it shouldn’t be dependent on data stored on my disk, especially after a fresh install.

   Issue — Can’t get all my apps back, Station thinks I’m a new user. Probably there are at least 3 accounts associated with my email address by now.

### [How can I transfer my Station setup to another
device?](https://faq.getstation.com/general-questions/how-can-i-transfer-my-

Whether you want to copy or migrate your Station.

But it doesn’t clarify if the zip files generated can be used in transferring
a station configuration between Mac and Windows machines. Can it? If not, is
there another way? Or must I start from scratch?

Thanks.

Hey [@BobbySciortino](/u/bobbysciortino),

Thanks for reaching out!  
Indeed the article is not clear about transferring your configuration from an
OS to another: it’s currently not supported so it most probably won’t work.

Syncing your account in the cloud is something we plan to work on in the
future: for the moment you’ll unfortunately have to reconfigure your Station.

Thanks for your patience

SUMMARY  
When can we expect Your Incredible Program to Snyc across Devices as Most
Programs Do 

As a … I want to … so that …

[p]Most Programs that are used on more than one computer sync so you don’t
have to double to triple your workload and know which version and which apps
you have on which computer on which Station. I have 3 Windows 10 laptops of
various sizes I use for different reasons, one like a tower, one as a around
the hour or laptop, one is a window tablet. I use Station on all Three. I
login to all three. I use the same email accounts and apps on all three. I
login using the same account on all three. Adobe, Microsoft, Corel, Google,
every company that has multiple programs syncs their devices I guess using a
cloud which doesn’t sound too difficult since that technology is now low cost
and efficient. I think people would even pay you for the for storage or let
people choose where they store the files, as everyone now has cloud storage,
like one drive or Google Drive. I Have FULL confidence in your brilliance, I
guess my question is, are you PLANNING on doing this or NOT as it WILL affect
peoples choices eventually in using you long term.I know I would pay 10 bucks
a month for my stuff to sync across every computer, even if it was an optional
thing you could offer people, I think you would be surprised how many would
choose to take advantage of it, as most people on the level of user that use
your software ALL have more than one PC. SO whats the good news or is it bad
news…Namaste, Bry P.S. …your spell checker REALLY needs some work. I know i
asked for one and you did give us one but its worse than the standard Windows
spell check, it missed so many misspellings I have to rely on putting docs
into Word and then using its Spell Check so its not even helping. I’m guessing
if you a poll, others would agree, unfortunately It also will not let you add
or ignore words even. Any news on Grammarly or some other more efficient one
hopefully…[/p]

I found a workaround using the app ChronoSync, which allows you to sync
folders between networked computers.

Figuring out how to sync two folders on ChronoSync is easy enough once you run
it, and there are probably several other apps that do it as well. I’m only
using ChronoSync because I have it free with Setapp, and it’s a trustworthy
name.

The only folder you have to sync is the Station database folder, which is
located at ~/Library/Application Support/Station/db. Just sync that folder
(and the contained files) to another computer to clone your setup.

I’ve had zero issues with this. Station support actually recommended this
method to me – albeit manually without ChronoSync – so it should be fine.
ChronoSync does the same thing, just easier.

Important Notes:

   Before syncing, make sure Station is both UPDATED and then CLOSED on both computers.
   Do a one-way sync , not bi-directional. Station sometimes updates the DB files when when you close the app, which will make them the “newest” files, which may not necessarily be the DB you prefer.
   Do not set up an automatic or scheduled sync. Only do it manually when you need to, when all instances of Station are closed (and up-to-date).

I hope that helps everyone with this issue!

Thanks to a Setapp member’s recommendation I’m now a recent happy Station
user.  
I’ve spent a fair bit of time setting it all up just the way I need it and now
I’m wondering if my setup will be synced over to another mac after I install &

If not, is there some manual way to copy some setup files over so I can avoid

Hello,

Whatever the platform (Windows or Mac), if I install Station on a new device
and login with my account, none of my apps are recovered. I have to start
configuring all my apps from scratch like I just created a new account. Isn’t
it supposed to recognize my account and apps I linked previously ?

I don’t know if I’m missing something with the instructions, but that’s very
frustrating. I try to have all my apps configured correctly so that if I
change my device, I’m able to recover them immediately…but doesn’t seem to
work…

Is this feature coming soon or not? If not, I’ll stick with Franz even though
it seems to hog resources more than Station. I’ve got multiple computers that
I use almost daily and I’m not going to spend time setting them all up. With
Franz you do this just once and then your setup follows your account on what
ever computer you’re on. No excuse to not implement this critical feature.

While this is one of the reasons I don’t use station, the main reason is that
the clipboard doesn’t work. There is no point in having Gmail in station

As a user I want to enable to hide the menu bar, just like at VSCode. There’s

I agree. I use things like this in fullscreen and the grey bar stands out
horribly. It may be a quicker development task just to add a hide option under
the view menu item. Once you click hide make a little toast popup explaining
how to bring it back (usually [ALT] or [ESC] or mouse-over top bar).

It should implement Metro/Rambox UI but hiding it first would be even better.

It’s very annoying: each time I click on a link corresponding to an app

Say you don’t want to install the LinkedIn Station app. You get an email to
your gmail account (in station) with a LinkedIn link and you click it. Since
you never installed the LinkedIn Station app, you would expect the link to
open in your browser. However, it opens in station, and you need to log in.

To prevent this you “remote” the LinkedIn station app… but that doesn’t solve
the problem, as clicking that email link opens in Station again.

The solution would be to not open links for possible station apps which you
don’t have an account configured for.

When I click on a link from an email that goes to an app that station
supports, e.g. Stripe, LinkedIn, Instagram, SmartSheet, etc, but which I have
chosen not to add to my sidebar, that app is added to my sidebar and the link
is opened there.

This is incredibly frustrating for two reasons:

The first is that, I have explicitly chosen not to add some apps to the
sidebar. I now have to close both the window that has opened, and remove the
app from the sidebar, each time I click on a link.

Worse than that though is that certain apps opened in this way do not work. I
clicked a Stripe link, and went through account registration, which then
failed. I have to manually copy and paste the link into Chrome in order to get
the behaviour I would expect.

Now I’m sure this is a feature that would split your community, so an option
to turn this on or off would be great. I haven’t been able to find it, but if
it exists, please let me know where.

COMPLETELY agree with the folks on this thread. Its INCREDIBLY ANNOYING to
have to keep removing applications only to have it added back automatically
the next day, as soon as I click on a link. Users prefer to use some of the
apps via their browsers… while using others within Station. Why is this so
difficult to understand? If your intent is to tell people “we have an app for
that”, then put in a (non-irritating) message or notification that tells us
that… dont unilaterally install an app, without even asking me - especially
when I have deleted that 100 times already! Gah!

This feature was released in Station v1.13.0

Now upon clicking a link to an app that’s not in your Station dock , we
will ask you if you wish to open it in Station or your default browser (and

Since JIRA app within workstation is not working at all (cannot be logged in

Unfortunately - whenever I open JIRA link from email JIRA app appears on

with lever & SFDC).

I am also unable to remove an application from Station, it removes the icon

Daniel, at least for me it auto-installs but it puts a overlay on it asking

In v1.43.2 at least, it opens it in Station, allows you to say “no, open in
browser instead”, but by doing so it eats the link somehow.

I would really prefer a setting where it doesn’t intercept my links, forcing
me to say “no”, wait, close the broken link window, go back to station, click
the link again.

If I use some site often enough I’ll add it to Station myself.

 SUMMARY I’d like Gmail in Station to support multi-language use just as
Gmail can in Chrome.

As a person who regularly switches between to languages, I want the spell
check in Gmail to recognize that I’m often using a language other than English
so that I only see words underlined in red when I actually made a spelling
error (and not every time I a language different than English).

GIVE US CONTEXT (tell us about the current experience)

When I use Gmail in Station and start typing in German, basically every word
is underlined because Gmail thinks I made spelling mistakes.

PROVIDE DETAILS (tell us what you are looking to change)

I’d like Gmail in station to use more than one dictionary at once.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT (how would it change your experience)

The main advantages for me are: I’d start using Gmail in Station. Right now
it’s too annoying as the spelling suggestions don’t make any sense when I’m
writing in German.

To take this a step farther than just for multiple language support it needs
to have a dictionary that is editable. For example if I regularly email
someone name Rajiv it always says that the spelling is wrong. If I use the
name of an application like Altium it says the name is spelled wrong. If I use
an English word that is not in the untouchable dictionary it says it is
spelled wrong.

That is fine if the dictionary allows the addition of words. Gmail the
application I am using allows me to add words to the dictionary. But when I
use Gmail in Station the words I have added to my gmail dictionary are still
highlighted as misspelled.

Here is an example of what I get in Station with a misspelled word.  

Here is the same word with the spelling menu from gmail.  

Please make the dictionary functional or allow it to be turned off, or just
use the dictionary included in the application that you are running.  
Thanks

While I type an email, the misspelled words do not get underlined in red

There are a few other threads mentioning similar issues, but nothing exactly
like this. I just don’t get the red underlines when I type emails in Gmail. I
uninstalled and reinstalled Station. The only way to get spellcheck is to
manually open the Gmail spell checker. I would prefer continuous spell check
as I type. I believe the red underlines worked before, but has not worked in
the last few weeks.

Came here to ask for the same thing — the `shift` \+ `option` \+ `space`

I use `shift` \+ `option` \+ `-` to type em dashes, and often this leads to an
accidental `shift` \+ `option` \+ `space` when I’m just trying to type with
proper punctuation. While I’m sure I’ll eventually reach the laser precision

For my part, I often select an expression in an app and look up its meaning in
a dictionary. Outside Station I can do this from a command in the ‘Services’
menu (to which I assign a keyboard shortcut). I cannot do this within Station,
as I cannot access Services menu when I’m on it. I would love it if, when the
shortcut problem is resolved, the commands registered within the 'Services’
menu were made accessible as well.

   Stop from closing Station to be able to use the key mapping within another application that is dependent on my workflow

Keyboard layout switching with Alt+Shift causes Edit menu opening

SUMMARY  
Custom quick-switch keyboard shortcut

I’d like to be able to customize what keys I smack to get the quick-switch up.
⌘T is fine, but in most other applications that pops open a new tab.

GIVE US CONTEXT  
Tell us about the current experience

In Chrome I can configure Quick Tabs which I have set up to trigger with ⌘E.

A few other environments… In Visual Studio I’ve got ⌘P for “Go to File…”,
configurable but I live with it. In Simplenote I have to twist into a ⌥⌘F to
switch between notes and die a little bit each time (literally, these wrists
won’t last forever).

Thanks for the great software and considering my feature request!

That’s helpful but I don’t think it lets us turn off Station’s keybindings,

I’m still unable to remap Opt+Shift+Space without station showing Quick

Hi. I’m having the same problem as others here. I’m looking to add “Teamwork”.
When I search it brings up Teamweek, and there’s no “request” button. So I

I see what is happening.

When you type in the app, if there is already an app with the same basic word
formation (i.e. Teamweek vs. Teamwork ) the search defaults to showing
only the existing/supported app(s) and no option to request the desired app is
shown. If you add a space to the end of your typed word (in this case
Teamwork [space] then the Request teamwork button will appear.

Odd behavior to be sure, but it does work.

In my case, our IT folks ‘protect’ our google suite access by using Elastica.
This works fine in the product I was using before (i.e. Shift ) but when I try
to get gmail (or calendar or gdrive) from Station all I see is the message:  
Welcome to Elastica  
The service you are trying to access is secured by Elastica. You must install
the Elastica Gateway SSO Helper in order to access it.

Where would I request support for that? It’s not really an app or extension. I
guess it’s a Chrome Extension. Is that something that is planned?

Could a status for a request be posted once it’s been reviewed for inclusion
with Station? It would be nice to know if a suggested app has been looked at
but won’t be included (and as Station’s popularity grows, perhaps it might
encourage developers of those apps to make it easier for those apps to be
included in Station in future?).

For example, I suggested Join (much cheaper and more flexible version of
Pushbullet) a couple of months ago. If it’s already been reviewed by Station’s
developer and declined for inclusion at the moment, it would be nice to know
that is the current status (and reasons why it won’t be included, if there are
technical reasons).

Thanks for your feedbacks, it helps us figure out the direction for
improvements!

For context, we put in place the webview sleeping system so that Station does
not slow down computers despite the fact it is running dozen of web
applications.  
Though, we want it to be as transparent as possible for the user and that it
just works without user needs to worry about configuration.

Currently, we have implemented only the version 1 of this system and it was
planned to improve it with the feedbacks received. Here we are!

The problem with the current version is that it puts apps to sleep too
aggressively, i.e. systematically after a some delay (at the exception of some
apps). We have planned to improve that in coming weeks so that you should
see way less loading pages, especially on frequently used apps.

Hope it makes sense and that we’ll hear your feedbacks.

No, I don’t want to see less loading pages, I want to see no loading
pages. Why tweak the system when you can simply let a user indicate to not let
it sleep? I’m 99% certain you already have some “never-sleep” rules in place,
since I never get loading pages for e.g. Drive while only using it maybe two
times per week.

Why not just let us decide as well?

I switched to Station from Franz and one of the only issues that I don’t like

It seems that whenever I go idle/do something else, when I come back to
Station all my apps have been shut down, and have to reload. Some of them take
a while to reload so this is pretty much a dealbreaker for me - a browser
isn’t as nice as Station but it doesn’t kill tabs I had open for no reason.

I just noticed a desktop notification that disappeared very quickly, but by
going to the Mac Notification Center I can see that this behavior may even be
intentional? “Your battery is safe”, excellent, good to know that my plugged-
into-the-wall battery isn’t going to suffer to keep the work I need open.

This is not a feature, this is a bug. If you want to add mysterious “close
apps to conserve battery” behavior - which in some cases could cause people to
even lose work! - please make it an option, and definitely don’t do it when
battery is at 100% and plugged in.

I also need this feature to work easily, it should ask every time I download a
file so I won’t need to open the default later. Besides, it would be total if,
after the download, I am able to click on the pop-up and then open the file
directly (currently it opens the folder). I guess having both options like in
Chrome would fit perfectly.

I was a Franz user until yesterday and got frustrated with downloads and
opening links which would hang. I found Station and I am hooked - great work.
especially the download feature. but I was expecting to see a checkbox saying
“Ask where to save each file before downloading” like Google Chrome allows -
see image attached:

I am already converted to Station (great work!) but this is a relatively
simple fix for an excellent feature (I am a windows software developer of 20
years!)… and hope that you could find the time in your busy feature path to
include this as would make a massive difference personally (and stop me to
going back to gmail in Chrome just to save invoices etc into folders I want).

SUMMARY

When browsing the open pages of a Station, I need a way to read the whole page
title.

As a GDrive user with long document names, I want to see the full doc name /
page title when hovering so that I know which page I’m opening.

GIVE US CONTEXT  
Tell us about the current experience

Station menu is fixed-width, which doesn’t matter for most apps that just have
a ‘Home’ page. For heavy cloud-drive users with multiple open docs, this can
be challenging to browse via mouse because the number of visible characters is
limited. If you use a standard naming convention for docs - e.g. “ [detailed]”
- then titles may be indistinguishable.

️ PROVIDE DETAILS  
Tell us what you are looking to change

Develop a UI solution to display more/all of a page’s title when browsing by
mouse.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT  
How would it change your experience

The main advantages for me are:

   save a whole lot of time
   decrease frustration
   superior to Quick Switch when “browsing” rather than “searching” and when already using mouse

I am reiterating this request with the same one I added on another thread that
seemed like last time it was touched it was last year:

Same here. Our team uses JIRA and Confluence. Both Atlasian apps. When adding
one account, the JIRA, one Atlasian icon goes up. When adding Confluence, the
same icon goes up. We cannot rename them, cannot change the icon. Cannot
rename the link we have just added under them, so if the title is long, we get
usually the same beginning, for ie: Our company’s name. So We need 2 things.
Ability to change icons, And, Ability to rename the main icon and anything
inside that icon. Thanks!!!

 Shortcut to close windows (your need in one sentence)

As a user I want to be able to close (secondary) windows (apart from the
“home” window of every app) with a shortcut.

When I have multiple windows of one app open in Station, I can only close them
via the little popup when hovering over the app icon in the sidebar, but not
with a shortcut.

I’d like have a Mac menu option (that I can assign a shortcut to or already
has one) for “Close window”.

 SUMMARY (your need in one sentence)

As a user, I would like to be able to use a keyboard shortcut to close the
currently visible open document/tab.

GIVE US CONTEXT (tell us about the current experience)

It’s quick to open documents, but I find the application sub-lists to be
continually cluttered with documents that I no longer care about or are not my
immediate attention. I would like to remove them quickly, just like how Cmd+W
will close tabs in a browser.

PROVIDE DETAILS (tell us what you are looking to change)

Add Cmd+W as a shortcut to close the current tab. Don’t allow it to close the
application’s main view (Gmail’s Home, Drive’s Home, etc).

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT (how would it change your experience)

The main advantages for me are:

   Faster, simpler, better control of tabs and documents that are open.

The max productivity gain for me would be with Google Drive, sometimes I just
open a document, and quickly glance through and close it. Quick Switch works
well for opening, but I wish it would close easily with a keyboard shortcut.

The result is tons of open docs making it harder to find the one you want.

I agree. Cmd-W to close the current tab/page in the active application would
be a huge time saver. Having to go to the mouse to click is time consuming.
When you have many, many documents open in Google Drive then you may need to
even scroll and find the current document/bolded item which could require
scrolling. Cmd-T/Quick Picker is not good enough yet at returning the results
I need and sometimes I just need to open a doc to see if it is the correct
one. Being able to immediately close it with a key combo when I realize it
isn’t the document I needed would be huge.

 SUMMARY Keyboard shortcut to close an application’s current pane

I would love Station to have the browser equivalent of Cmd+W

GIVE US CONTEXT (tell us about the current experience)

Take this example. I’m in Gmail reading a message and I click on a Google Doc
link someone sent me. It opens in Station and takes me right to it. After I’m
done reading this Google Doc I want to close it (Cmd+W) and have it take me
back to whatever thing I was doing before that.

Right now, after I’m done reading I end up press Cmd+1 which takes me back to
my Gmail application but I accumulate a ton of Google Docs. This exact same
thing happens a lot with Trello where I’m clicking a link of a Trello card
that someone emails to me.

PROVIDE DETAILS (tell us what you are looking to change)

I’d like to be able to close an application’s window with Cmd+W

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT (how would it change your experience)

The main advantages for me are:

   I would be able to work faster without having to use the mouse as much
   I would accumulate fewer open application windows

Can this shortcut be added? I usually open 10 google docs and I cant find a

in chrome that closes tabs. Window-> Close works only for detached windows and

Hey [@Teej](/u/teej)

Thanks for reaching out.  
The place to request apps or extensions is directly within Station (and
not here ). They’re added to Station every month by popularity order.

Hey Georges,  
I tried requesting the grammarly extension based on the method mentioned. But
everytime it shows a popup (which is awesome btw and had used to add lots of
my company private websites) to add it as app. We don’t need grammarly app but
the extension. Can you please elaborate on how to request for an extension

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that I’m expecting Github and Zenhub to work together, and they
don’t. There is a chrome extension that adds Zenhub functionality to Github
pages, so when I use Github within Station my workflow is broken.

You can find the extension here: <https://www.zenhub.com/extension>

There is a new Chrome extension called Simplify developed by [Michael
Leggett](https://leggett.org/), with some help from friends. He was Gmail’s
lead designer from 2008 to 2012

<https://simpl.fyi/gmail/>

It does a really nice job of removing the Gmail noise that the new design has.

Hi all,

I am just wondering whether we can use Google drive’s offline mode on station
app.  
It seems the offline mode works only on google chrome browser as it requires
to download a chrome extension to enable the offline mode. However, if someone
knows the answer, I would like to know how to turn on the offline mode on
station app.

Thank you.

SUMMARY  
I would like to use my Gmail Enhancement apps within the Station Window

Gmail on it’s own is not the best UI experience for me. I use MixMax, Streak,
Sortd and other tools that make Gmail far more functionall for my day and my
business.  
I appreciate all of my gmail accounts in Station but I am missing all of my
CRM, Calendaring and team functionality. I have over a hundred templates that
save me from repetitive typing and functionality to make sure my clients read
and respond to my emails.  
I also use a number of interface enhancements that make it more efficient,
better for my eyes, and easier to use the keyboard shortcuts.

I would love for app use to be considered so I can stay within the Station App
for my full business day.

Thanks.

I agree… at least with the in-app notifications

 SUMMARY (your need in one sentence)

Locks app with a PIN/password option

GIVE US CONTEXT (tell us about the current experience)

Since all of my gmail and other accounts are accessed here; accessing my
PC/Laptop gives access to all of them.

PROVIDE DETAILS (tell us what you are looking to change)

What I need, is a feature (of course configurable, optional by default), which
asks for my PIN/password, every time I open the app.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT (how would it change your experience)

The main advantages for me are:

   I can still run the app but the App screen will say LOCKED
   Every time I start the App would ask for the PIN/password which would block unauthorized access.
   Usually friends and family members can access each others PC/laptops from time to time; this feature will help a lot for sneaking anything from Station app.

lock it with a password, preferably with an MFA option. To another poster’s
point, I do have a password on my Mac, but until I can also protect that with

Hello,  
New user of Station, look very great and I thank the developers, but… It’s
really non sense not to be able to use a master password when open the
application (just like Rambox for example) !  
Nowadays security has to be an imperative! This should not be a wish, but
should absolutely exist !  
Thanks for taking it into account. Without this, Station will stay in “stand

On my mouse (Logitech MX Anywhere 2) is use the two side-buttons for
back/forward. I use those buttons a lot in the browser.

In Logitech Options those two buttons are simply configured as back and
forward. That works in Chrome. In Station they don’t work that way. I have
to configure the buttons to ctrl + [ and ctrl + ] , but those shortcuts
don’t work in Chrome.

Would it be possible to ad the functionality for my mouse to use the back
and forward buttons to work in Station?

I use the same mouse. You can set up the CTRL-[ and CTRL-] shortcuts to the
back/forward buttons on a “per app” basis in Logitech Options. In the top
right, click “All Applications” and toggle the application specific settings

 SUMMARY

As a user I want the system preferences to be honoured so that i can use my
regular gestures throughout Station

GIVE US CONTEXT

When I have my system preferences set to 3 finger swipe to change desktop and
2 finger swipe to go forward/back the 2 finger gesture is not honoured within
Station (It looks like a 3 finger swipe would work according to [Previous and
Next buttons on the UI](https://community.getstation.com/t/previous-and-next-
buttons-on-the-ui/91/6?u=marcroberts) )

PROVIDE DETAILS

I’d like this setting to be honoured and the 2 finger forward/back gesture to
work as expected in Station (as it does in all my browsers)

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT

The main advantages for me are:

   being able to use Station more, as i’m trying to switch my ‘work’ Chrome profile in to station, while also still using Chrome for regular browsing

 SUMMARY

As a MacBook user (while I’m working mobile), I’ve gotten fairly accustomed to
trackpad gestures for swiping between webpages (a two finger swipe right to go
back a page, and a swipe left to go forward again.) I’ve been loving
incorporating Station into my new business workflow. The only thing I can’t
get used to is not having these page forward / page back gestures for the
trackpad.

It would be amazing if you could add these gestures in to move forward and
back through each tab’s page history. I’d assume it would be a simple few
lines of code to hook in these gestures.

You should see me swiping back and forth a few times before I eventually
realize that I need to click the page history forward / back buttons. I get a
tad bit flustered with myself every time I remember it’s not incorporated.

CONTEXT

To provide a better workflow solution for Apple MacBook and Mac Trackpad
users, I’d love it if two finger swipe left / right gestures could be added to
Station. This would be great for all Apple users who typically use / are
accustomed to trackpad gestures in other web browsing applications.

PROVIDE DETAILS

Fairly simple. I’d love to see the MacOS code hooks for using two-finger swipe
left / right trackpad gestures added into Station. This would add greater
functionality in workflow, and save a lot of time clicking between those
little back / forward buttons.

Try using the gesture in Safari, and see how much easier it is to move through
page history.

IMPACT

The main advantages are:

   Moving faster through each app’s / extension’s pages
   Providing greater app workflow
   Low implementation time versus high time-saving / smoother workflow functionality

This may be muscle memory coming from a browser, but I miss being able to
swipe to the previous page. Safari’s is particularly great since I can half
swipe to read what I was looking at and return without actually going back,
but Chrome also implements this as a gesture.

 SUMMARY (your need in one sentence)

shortcuts or find a back button in an application.

GIVE US CONTEXT (tell us about the current experience)

When I use station in all webapps, I have to either use a keyboard shortcut or
find an app provided back button to navigate pages when I would rather use
standard mouse buttons. These work across Windows in all apps which support
“back” - except Station.

However 1 thing that I like about 5+ windows is the ability for split screen

Station app itself or by them letting us have tabs is up to them… But I really
want this idea to come true.

For everyone following this issue, I found a solution. There are two ways of
entering split view—you can either do it by holding down the full screen
button (which doesn’t work with Station), or with the following method:

  1. Enter full screen with Station
  2. Once in full screen, open Mission control and drag your desired app on top of the Station Space you wish to split. (you can also drag another full-screen app)

This will combine the two apps into a split-screen Space.

Hi [@Cedric](/u/cedric),

We understand the struggle.

To give some context, we realized that most of the web-apps usually integrate
navigation controls that makes browser’s back and forth button redundant. More
than redundancy, we wanted the make the Station’s UI as minimalist as possible
to give more space to the web-app itself.

That being said, we kept several ways to do a back without having a button in
the interface:

   there is a menu History > Back
   right clicking gives you the contextual menu with a back button
   there is a shortcut available: `CmD+[` on Mac, `Ctrl+[` on Windows
   on Mac you can swipe with 3 fingers to go back (see configuration details [here](http://faq.getstation.com/basic-functionalities-and-core-features/how-do-i-go-back-and-forth-on-a-page-on-station))

Station. I read your link, and I think that allowing a search engine is not
the same as allowing access to any website, but more like adding another
Google app. I can already click external links in GMail, why shouldn’t I be
able to do the same from Google Search? I think the option should be
available.

Adding to Jerry’s point. Not everyone is a pro at their jobs, there are
rookies like me who need the Internet’s help. One of the main reasons people
install Station is to avoid high resource usage by Chrome and its inefficiency
despite using those resources. Not to mention the obvious distractions
attached to it. By restricting users from being able to search, you’re forcing
them to open Chrome which defeats one of the main purposes of installing
Station.

I understand your view of Station not being a replacement for browsers but you
need to understand that a quick search is indeed a web-application
which is part of people’s workflow. So going by your value proposition of “A
single place for all of your web-applications.” , it is only fair and
logically correct to include a web-application.

PS - If people have installed Station, it shows their commitment to being
focused and productive. Customer acquisition is tough, so when people are
committing themselves to this extent, it should show they’d use the search
web-application wisely.

use a traditional browser instead of the station? Isn’t this a little

Station usage gets tracked as only one item regardless of windows/tabs/states

currently the window name, no matter where you are is “Station”

IMAP and POP are protocols. You still need some kind of web application to
access the mail, as far as I know. I use the Roundcube webmail client on my

Brief description of the issue

Hello Station team,

There’s a bug with the Atlassian JIRA app menu where I have a Page marked as
favourite but every time I click on it, a duplicate entry is created in the
menu and that’s the one that becomes highlighted. This is really annoying
because the menu gets bigger unnecessarily. Please see the picture below where
you can see this behaviour.

Job to be done:  
When I’m finished with a google document I want to quickly find that document
in the sub-dock and close it so my colleagues don’t think I’m still looking at
it.

Problem is:  
When I have 25+ google documents open (which happens frequently and is a
different problem), its extremely difficult to locate to the currently open
document. This stems from two problems:  
1\. There is no sort order \- files seems to be added to the list at any
random point. If it was sorted alphabetically or by recently opened then I
could easily predict where the document is in the list. Today I have to scroll
up and down through the list hunting for the document.  
2\. The highlighting of the open file is way too subtle \- There should be
lots more contrast to the currently open file so its easily identifiable. The
slight, white gradient is useless.

I click on the Google Drive icon and it opens a long list of all the

way of seeing quickly which tab is a doc and which is a sheet…

Also, I’d like to be able to re-order this list, alphabetically or manually.

I’d like to disable Quick-Switch on program start. Quick-Switch is listed on

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT

The main advantages for me are:

   Quick-Switch is of little/no use. All my accounts/apps are displayed in the right-side menu.

I came here to echo this note. I have Station open to my Slack channel every
time my computer starts up, and while I know it’s just a click of a button… It
does become a little aggravating that I need to close quick-switch on every
startup. I feel like it should not open automatically, or have an option to
disable the automatic quick-switch window on app open.

SUMMARY

Add a configuration option to allow me to not show the “Jump to…” dialog when
Station starts up.

GIVE US CONTEXT

When I start station I don’t want to be asked to choose what application I
want to use.

PROVIDE DETAILS

Configuration options to make it so that everything works the way I want it
to. Sure you guys have a lot of great ideas, but I grew up with different
surroundings. Therefore it makes more sense for me to do things differently
than what you have set as default.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT

The main advantages for me are:

   I would be in my email instead of having to click on something before I was.
   I don’t want you to try and make me think that I don’t want to see my email first thing when I start station.
   I just want it to leave me alone and not ask if I want to jump to something else. If I want to change to a different application I can click the icon on the side!

I agree, it’s really annoying. Don’t get me wrong, I like the “Jump to…”
feature, I just don’t want it in my face every time I start the app. What’s
the reasoning behind that anyway??? It’s like if Spotlight search
automatically launched every time you logged into your Mac or unlocked your

After having the Quick Switch popup in my face one too many times, I went to
its setting to turn it off, only to be disappointed there was nothing there.
Then I came here – for the first time – to request the ability to turn it off
(but still have the feature available via keyboard shortcut and maybe a menu
toggle.) To my surprise, the first issue I see in the list is this one. So,
I’m with everyone else, it’s very intrusive behavior, indeed.

ETA  
I recommend defaulting to last open app before exit. Also, add a setting, one
that could be turned on or off, which will allow us to choose default app to
open upon app start. One which would override defaulting to last open app
before exit. If it was turned off, defaulting to last open app would kick in
again.

The issue I’m facing is …

I would like to use Station for several web apps related to my job, but NOT
for my Gmail, Google Calendar, or Google Drive – I’m perfectly happy with my
existing solutions for those, I’m looking for a one-stop shop for OpsGenie,
HoneyBadger, NewRelic, and other tech-related monitoring apps.

I thought Station would be perfect for this use case. However, when I
downloaded it and installed it, it starts by requiring me to connect it to
my work-related Google account – which I specifically do not want! I cannot
find any other option to bypass this and proceed to setting up the web apps I
do want!

If Station is going to make all the decisions about which web apps I use it
for, instead of allowing me to make those decisions, then it’s a non-starter
for me.

Is there a way to bypass this step and go ahead to set up just the apps I
want?

I downloaded Station for Mac recently only to realise that it required me to
sign in with a Google account, and that was the only option available. I was
quite disappointed and I had to to delete the application.

I’m not sure if it is a limitation imposed by the design of the app but it
will be good to allow users to use any account to sign in (or at the very
least, disclose the limitations before they download the installer).

I don’t use station for my email, so it would be nice if clicking a link

this:

   The ability to set Station as my default browser. This would also need configuration for which browser to redirect to if I open a link to a website that doesn’t have a station app.
   The ability to open a link in a station app from the clipboard. It’s less convenient, but for the few websites I have in station I wouldn’t mind copying a link from my email and hitting a button in station to navigate to it.

 SUMMARY

As a Google Docs user I want to open Google Docs shared links from other apps
in Station instead of my default browser so that I can have all my open docs
consolidated in Station.

GIVE US CONTEXT

When I receive a Google Docs shared link in Slack or email, and I click on it,
the doc opens in my default browser (Chrome). If I want it open in Station, I
have to go to Station, select, ‘Shared with me’ and find the document and open
it.

PROVIDE DETAILS

I’d like Station to capture that link and open it like other docs opened
inside station.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT

The main advantages for me are:

   Streamlined workflow. If I am replacing my browser with Station, then I don’t want to use the browser and Station should default to the app for all that I have configured in it.

I agree with [@SameerBhiwani](/u/sameerbhiwani). Links that go from one
Station app to another, should open in the destination app’s “tab”, rather in
the default browser. However, links that open a new domain/subdomain/app
that’s not associated with a Station app, should open that outside Station in
the default browser. This is more intuitive and natural.

Station should be a Standalone browser rather than an application just for the

definitely replace my usage of chrome with station. It would be nice, i.e when

It would also help if each tab’s icon were colored when it were not selected
but highlighted some other way when selected because once you have a bunch of
tabs it can be more mental work to find the tab you want using only the icon
as a guide. I guess if I just got used to the keyboard shortcuts it would go
faster but right now there is a lot of excess mental power going into figuring
out which tab I really want to click on all the time. Note the attached

 SUMMARY (your need in one sentence)

As someone who uses the same app (Asana) for both work and personal, I want to
easily navigate between them so that it’s faster for me.

GIVE US CONTEXT (tell us about the current experience)

When I am trying to switch between instances of the same app via task switcher
(Cmd+t), both my personal and my work asana accounts shows up as “Asana”. This
does not help me find the right now.

PROVIDE DETAILS (tell us what you are looking to change)

I’d like to be able to rename instances of Asana myself.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT (how would it change your experience)

The main advantages for me are:

   I can actually use task switcher to switch between instances of the same app efficiently.

Same here. Our team uses JIRA and Confluence. Both Atlasian apps. When adding
one account, the JIRA, one Atlasian icon goes up. When adding Confluence, the
same icon goes up. We cannot rename them, cannot change the icon. Cannot
rename the link we have just added under them, so if the title is long, we get
usually the same beginning, for ie: Our company’s name. So We need 2 things.

 SUMMARY (your need in one sentence)

I want to be able to see where a hyperlink in a gmail message is going to go
before clicking it.

GIVE US CONTEXT (tell us about the current experience)

The previous poster wanted this in the context of looking at phishing
attempts. I’m pretty confident in Google filtering out phishing attempts
recently (although the paranoid side of me wants this feature for that use
case too).

I’d like to have this feature because I subscribe to a number of
newsletter/round-up emails that often times collect links. By hovering I might
see the link is to an article I’ve already read or if it is to a site that I
don’t deem “high-quality” I won’t click. This saves times and avoids tab
fatigue.

PROVIDE DETAILS (tell us what you are looking to change)

I’d like the URL to display when I hover over a hyperlink in Gmail. Look at
Safari and turn on Status Bar (Cmd + /) then hover over a link and look at the
bottom of the screen. Look in Chrome (I believe it is on by default) in the
bottom left of the screen. Ditto for Firefox.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT (how would it change your experience)

   I would know to which site a link goes before clicking it and use that context to help me decide if I want to click
   I would click links with more confidence
   I would save time from following links which are not worthwhile
   There will be fewer tabs in my browser and hopefully I’ll have to declare tab bankruptcy and restart the browser less frequently.

When using the Slack app, the ‘Status’ icon and title appear to update to the
user (me), however, other users who do not see the updated status. For
example, if you set yourself to ‘Away’ in Slack, you will see yourself as
‘Away’, however, other users see you as ‘Active.’ It’s not just setting
yourself to ‘Away,’ but any status updates along with the icons that go with
the statuses. There are times where I will make a call to another team member,
which then shows a phone icon next to my name. That phone icon will stay
active all day, even after ending the call. Reloading or resetting the app
does not correct the issue.

I have contacted Slack, and was told this: “Thanks for getting back to me with
that link. However, that’s unfortunately not an app that was built by Slack so
I’m afraid that you’ll need to contact them for help with these problems that
you’re encountering with their app.”

 SUMMARY Let me toggle between application windows with Cmd+`

GIVE US CONTEXT (tell us about the current experience)

Imagine I’m working on a presentation in Station. I go to Google Doc > Home
and search for my presentation, opening it. Now I want to open a second Google
Doc, I have to use the mouse to hover back over Google Doc and go Home again,
I wish I could just type Cmd+` to take me back to the previous application
window.

Anyway, I use my mouse and go back to Doc search and open a second doc, it’s a
meeting notes doc.

Now I want to alternate frequently between my google doc meeting notes and my
google slideshow presentation. I have to use the mouse each time.

My current work-around is to detach one of the windows. After detaching the
window then I can do Cmd+` but it would be nice to just have a keyboard
shortcut for toggling between two application windows.

PROVIDE DETAILS (tell us what you are looking to change)

I know I can do Cmd+T to search and open a google doc without going back to
Google Doc > Home.

I also know I can use Cmd+t to and search all open applications.

Those two features are great, don’t lose those. But I just find the Cmd+` and
Cmd+Tab to be really powerful keyboard shortcuts and Station should support
some version of these.

Sorting in the “add apps and extensions” so we can see what apps are new.

As you just wrote in the patchnotes, you have just added over 50 new apps, yet

Can you add a switch to disable red dot of Slack channel message on dock icon.

For me, it’s not every message in group is useful. I just read these messages

In slack official app, If you turn off the notification of a channel, you

I’m not sure this is the best of solutions, and I have no idea how well it
applies to other apps, but if you use “Sign in to another workspace” from the
menu inside Slack instead of Station’s menu for adding a new team, then you
end up with multiple Slack workspaces under a single icon.

As far as I can tell, there are very few drawbacks:

   Station treats them all as one team in My Apps, including the settings for using the team logo in the dock (it seems to show whichever one I had active last) and keeping them active in the background or not
   From Station’s perspective they are also merged for the purposes of muting and un-muting notifications, so if you want per-team control over that you have to do it from within Slack
   You see each team listed separately when you mouse over the icon in the dock (unlike in My Apps), and “Add a new team” displays underneath that, which makes it look like that would be the place to add more teams with the same behavior, but that’s actually how to add a separate Station app/dock icon; for merging them under one, you need to do it from within the Slack interface, as mentioned above.

I had assumed that being able to do it either way was completely intentional,
because of how smoothly it works. Even Quick Switch and Recents seem to have
no problem with either setup.

A manual on-off switch would be much more deterministic, so an app/account
would never go online or consume any resources unless I explicitly want to use
it. This is especially useful for chat apps, that should be online all the
time to receive messages/calls, but currently it’s a pain in the butt to
delete and re-add them.

Or if someone uses their computer for both work and home stuff, this would be
also good for shutting down the “work” apps at home. I know there is a mute
switch for that, but again, it’s not deterministic enough.

It’s pretty much what [@MarkSMR](/u/marksmr) just said.

Sometimes I don’t want those apps to load, at all.  
I want them available on Station for when I need them (without having to re-

them to load.

Is there a way to disable / enable an app? For example: At the moment I don’t

SUMMARY  
Your need in one sentence

I would love to be able to turn off some apps without removing them.

GIVE US CONTEXT  
Tell us about the current experience

I have several professional related slacks that are using CPU/memory when I
use Station at home. It’s one use case among many others where I would like to
stop the app from running but keep it available in one click.

PROVIDE DETAILS  
Tell us what you are looking to change

The same way we can disable notifications from the sidebar for each apps,
display an icon to turn off the app to prevent Station from using too much
CPU/memory.  
Turned off apps should have a turn on icon that reload the app with the same
session/configuration.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT  
How would it change your experience

The main advantages for me are:

   I don’t want to appear online if I’m not using the app, and I don’t want to logout/change my status everytime
   I don’t want to use more CPU/memory than needed

Hello everyone…

It’s been about six months since this request was created. Is there any real
plan to implement such functionality? One point I’d like to add to the
discussion in terms of advantages is also that, as a laptop user, we would get
improved battery life.  
As discussed before, some of the apps can be quite heavy, forcing fans to spin
and thus decreasing battery life…

Can we just start progress on this please?

I should also mention that, for now, the lack of this functionality is the
ONLY reason keeping me on Franz instead of switching to Station…

Allow accounts to be viewed as a single account - email, calendars, etc.

The one thing that keeps me from switching entirely to Station is the apparent
inability to combine things like inboxes into a single inbox. The built-in
Windows 10 email client does this, and it’s quite handy to be able to see all
my unread emails from all accounts in a single location.

The same with calendars. Having a single calendar that combines elements from
all my calendars would be very helpful.

It’s a beautiful client with a ton of potential.

I think this could also be used for the case of many different amounts for the
same “app”. For example I have two different Confluence sites that I need to
access but they run with two different accounts. I cannot have both open in
station, even if I add them as two different apps, since they’re not self-

I’ve only just barely started using Station. I have looked on individual apps,

like it available.

FMessenger Dark Mode seems to only be available on the mobile app, for
example.

I don’t know what Franz is.

I named the browser extension “Dark Reader” because it puts almost all
websites into a Dark Mode and I was thinking along the same lines with
Station, if such a feature could be implimented to put the entire Station in a
Dark Mode instead of individual apps. “Dark Reader” has an option to turn off
for specific websites where the extension makes it more difficult to read the
site instead of improves it.

Thanks, I am on a mac, but I imagine there are also similar 3rd party
extensions for mac. That said, I still wonder if having it integrated into
Station natively would be useful. In a sense, Station created this problem
because I can no longer just arrange two windows next to each other easily,
which is why I have to keep flipping back and forth. I do wonder if the need
to transfer data between apps efficiently is something that could be useful to
many station users.

Hello [@YuankuiLI](/u/yuankuili)!

We’re sorry you have trouble finding that option. It’s something we will work
on.  
You can copy the current URL by doing a right click anywhere on the page and
you’ll have the option to “ Copy Current Page’s URL ”.  
If you can’t see that option (it’s possible in Gdrive suite) you can always go
to the Edit menu and find it there.

Dear Mr. Wilson,  
Dear Station,

I am in need of the same solution. I need salesforce inbox to track emails,
and log them into salesforce with the click of a button. Salesforce inbox
addon for chrome allows me to do this.  
I’d love to keep using Station (and potentially my team), but i’m afraid this
will become a deal-breaker…

Regards,  
Steven

Hi [@Aron](/u/aron),

Sorry we only speak english or french for now. We understand that you want the
extension adblock?  
We don’t support other extensions for the moment. It’s something we are still
thinking about and can’t give you any timeline unfortunately.
