","Hey Alexandre,  
I think that definitely a few things could be done:

   Allow developers to add to an online database that stores information for every service being used(link etc) and create new services for other users.
   Give access to customizable CSS
   Release a web version?

Just a few suggestions.  
Really like the idea!

Dylan

[@dylan](/u/dylan) thanks for your ideas!

What do you mean by “an online database that stores information for every
service being used”?

Hi [@alexandre](/u/alexandre) ,  
I mean that it might be cool to have some sort of database or spreadsheet that
lists everything available in Station(GDocs, GitHub, Slack, etc…), shows basic
info that allows the app to run each individual site, and lets developers
custom add other things they want on Station without it being a hassle.

What apps are being built by Station? I’d love to see spotify and other apps
be added to make Station a friendlier application beyond work-specific apps.

That being said, there are a couple improvements I can think of:

   Back/forward button - the browser experience is limited if you can’t go back or forward and have to rely on a web apps navigation buttons to get around.
   Notifications should disappear - ex. after downloading a pdf, the notification is persistent instead of expiring in a few moments.
   Keyboard shortcut to jump to different tabs - if this already exists, in-app tutorial would be highly beneficial.

How can developers contribute to Station?

As a developer, I would love to see the ability to build an “Add to Station”
button, to quickly add a new app with some configuration variables (account-
level things) to apps we build that Station supports.

As a developer, I’d love a Station SDK to help us expedite the time it takes
the Station team to support our apps. Some kind of pre-approval checker.and
hooks that require station developers to build currently.

I am confused as to in how long the SDK will be available for beta testing. Is
that known yet? If so in how long?

Hello,

Are their any plans to let developers create their own apps for Station? To
build apps forcustom in-house tools we have.

For example where I work, we have a team of backend developers who makes API’s
and mobile/game developers. It would be great if we could create a simple app
where we can bundle the API documentations in one app.  
Currently the API documentation for each application is hosted on a unique
URL, so the Station app would simply need to be able to add URL’s to itself,
just like how the Jira app in Station does at the moment.

The idea of the SDK is very good, and I am looking forward to when it would be
released. Is there is an estimated date of release?

Hi [@StaU](/u/stau),

Sorry for the late answer and thanks for your question!

Actually, Electron is not exactly a modified version of Chromium, it does
include elements of Chromium (esp. the [content
module](http://www.chromium.org/developers/content-module)) but not all of
them. For instance, the module and APIs to support the Chrome extensions is
missing from original Electron versions.

Some Electron-based applications decided to import Chrome extensions modules
and API from Chromium into Electron. That’s the case of Brave.  
We could not re-import Chrome extensions modules from Chromium because our
interface and architecture is to too far from Chromium’s one (in opposite to
Brave). We rather decided to re-implement Chrome extensions APIs and adapt it
to our interface and needs. But this is not an easy task.

Note we might open-source our implementation at some point.

Hope it answers your question
