","I totally agree. There should be a way to add a delay so that the Station side
panel doesn’t open from the left (with app details) when hovering and
selecting an app.

As indicate, that panel covers up the web app and thus slows down the
switching between apps as you wait for that panel to close. For example, you
want to pick an app, see what’s new, pick the next app and so on. You
currently have to hover away from the app selection bar wait… wait, the panel
goes away, then you pick the next app.

It’s useful but I don’t need to see that every time I want to go between the
apps (I know there is keyboard shortcut but still a bit annoying).

I would be happy to have a setting to disable the hover and just use a right-
click.

Yes it makes sense.

We originally introduced this side-menu (we call it “sub-dock” ) so that
you can quickly switch between recently opened documents (for instance with
Google Drive). We then added info and buttons there, but that actually
requires less direct access.

Without adding a configurable option, the solutions you suggested, like adding
a delay, are clearly adoptable. I even think this menu should not exist if
there is no recent documents available (like for Gmail). We also consider
reducing the hover-zone that triggers the menu.

We’ll figure out how to prioritise that given our roadmap. We’ll let you know.

I’m facing the same problem here  I looked for a place to send a feedback
precisely because of this issue. It is much better when the settings are in a
settings section rather this hover shortcut.

This settings is something that we set one or two times and done with it. And
if shortcuts really matter, right click will do the job for advanced users.

Hi:
After using Station for a while, here is an observation. I am no expert; if
you place the “jump to” search bar at top and keep it stationary, then you
could have multiple columns of apps underneath (in the same space or less
even). If I only have 8 apps (as an example) then one column is sufficient,
(depending on the size of your screen of course). If I have 24 apps, then
three columns can appear below the search. Should you be able to customize
completely? Sure, but how much of a priority vs the other priorities on that
big plate.

It may be a quick fix so that the usage can guide the direction of it. The
columns of apps could collapse to the left, with the search bar stationary,
allowing a quick type and find for the app, activating the columns.Just a
thought. Thanks for reading.

I never use the hover menu. It’s distracting and annoying. Perhaps add a delay
on hover to show? or right click like other members suggested.

However I think it show still show at least the name of the app on hover, but
in a way that it doesn’t bother.

(1) hover menu covers important navigation items in underlying apps (2) it is
annoying that it comes up EVERY time. (3) the recessive black/grey background
makes it hard to read the page titles.

Knowing which app pages are open and having a way to quickly navigate to them
are both important , though. Perhaps expand the entire left sidebar upon
focus/hover and have the page titles appear vertically below the icon that was
hovered over. And then have the side bar collapse automatically upon loss of
focus?

Aside, IMHO, this is essentially a browser with, arguably, much better
navigation. Love the app and it has quickly become my go-to app.

One way to cover less screen space during sub-dock item hover (which might
also help this issue: [Left side menu's hover state sometimes disturbs left
side app menu's](https://community.getstation.com/t/left-side-menus-hover-
state-sometimes-disturbs-left-side-app-menus/162?u=qaid)), is to reduce the
number of UI element in the hover state.

### For Apps with single account:

(I confess, I haven’t thought about multiple account scenarios)

Additional advantages shown in the above Suggested hover:

   [Changing names of bookmarks](https://community.getstation.com/t/changing-names-of-bookmarks/320?u=qaid) (so hovering over “Google Drive” enables an edit mode where the title for the app instance becomes customizable)
   Reduced cognitive load: for app instances with a single account, the hover UI is smaller and doesn’t provide duplicate info/functionality (in current implementation the “Home” button does the same thing that the sub-dock item does). Additionally, all of the existing functions are preserved: popout to new window, add account, settings workflow.

Just to add to this, I only want to see one Gmail Icon or Calendar Icon on the
left vertical menu bar, once I click on that Icon, for example Gmail, I can
then see a list of all my Gmail accounts, and I want to personalize the name
as mentioned in the original post. It’s not very intuitive to have 3 or 4
“home” listings.

Unless I’m missing something when I try to add a second similar account
(gmail, calendar, etc), get station creates another icon at the bottom of the
vertical list. Just to repeat, I would strongly prefer to see only one
instance of the app icon listed in the left vertical menu. When there are
multiple accounts, they are visible by clicking on the parent icon.

After playing with station for a day or two, this is the only feature that is
keeping me from adding it to my daily workflow.

Jason

+1 for this, this hover is annoying, especially on laptop screens where space
is precious. Reworking the UI doesn’t have to happen now, or be a priority;
just give people the option to shut off the hover.

What about just change to the right the column?

Most of important things on webs/apps are on the left (usually way to read).
So if you want to change your screen, I think good position to not disturb
should be on the right.

Will a change ever get made here? This thread was started a year ago. It’s the
first annoyance someone encounters as a new user and doesn’t get much less
annoying over time. At least add a Preference option to have the app bar
appear on the RIGHT - as it was suggested above by [@Clopez](/u/clopez) \-
that’s a good starting point.

It seems this + renaming apps/favourites is a common enough requirement that
it should be prioritized already.

Having trouble believing that Station developers think the hover on the
sidebar is a good idea. It’s clunky, irritating, and omnipresent. I’ll have to
stop using Station, which is otherwise an excellent app, if there isn’t an
option to turn it off. (It’s kind-of like a great new sweater, that looks
great, keeps you warm, but itches really badly.)

This should be fixed in Station’s latest version (1.36)

right click on the app’s icon to open it. Could you update your Station
and tell us what you think?

I would have preferred a delay but still subdock-on-hover, especially since
there is now a tooltip on delay but it is anchored next to the icon instead of
to the mouse cursor, which combined with how it’s styled makes it look like
the subdock either is broken or has been moved to a sub-menu. I keep trying to
hover or click the tooltip, which of course disappears as soon as I’m not
hovering over the icon anymore, and wiggling my mouse back and forth trying to
get the behavior I’d become used to before I remember to right-click.

On the bright side, this might finally get me to build the habit of using the
quick-switch, if I don’t get frustrated and try to add the old subdock
behavior to my customization script first.

So, a good feature is now broken? Can we please get back the old behavior?
Station’s value just decreased by 50% for me.

And yes, now it’s broken…

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that my open instances don’t list upon hover of icon (e.g. open
Google docs aren’t visually listed when I hover over the Google doc icon). Is
this a feature or a bug?

remove the right click option on sidebar and revert to previous update. A lot
of apps are moving away from right click, seems like a backward move now we
have to right click the side bar. the icon on the cursor also looks cheap

I can see why the team moved away from a hover to a right click - to satisfy
the “average user”.

However, might be worth considering whether it’s confusing for a new user in
terms of discoverability. It’s not immediately obvious the desired action is
“right click”. I also wouldn’t expect a new user to realize that Station shows
multiple pages for an app.

As a power user, I find it a little annoying. Like someone mentioned, it’s
another click. And I think a similar problem exists for certain apps (like
Google docs) or Jira where you’re often in multiple pages at the same time. My
suggestion would be to refine the search functionality. Often when I search
something, the display flickers between different apps. For example, if I
search “product” to open a specific Google doc, it might open in a “product”
named slack channel instead because the search results flickered in the <1
second it took me to select my choice. Search is probably more useful for
power users anyways - 0 clicks involved!

SUPER hard to discover the new right-click functionality. I get that it’s
because I’m an existing user and the previous experience was a learned one.
I’m not sure a right click is the answer to an action that is a pretty
important primary action IMHO. But even so, a simple one step shepherd when I
entered the app to tell me how/point out how it has changed would have gone a
long way, the cursor icon isn’t enough. Ended up checking for software update
and then had to come to the community area as thought it was a bug!

I must be the only one in here who liked that. Maybe because I had multiple
pages per app I used. I actually found that to be an interesting use-case. I
thought there was a bug with the software when it went away.

So far I found no way to change that. After going thru the pain of setting up
an account for this chat community, I’m hoping someone can either help me get
an older version of station back, or let me know if there’s any work being
done on making that a setting. Cuz that’s a pretty useful feature and having
to right click on it all the time is fucking annoying

It used to be that when I mouse over the app icon on the left sidebar the
popover appears with the list of opened files. Now I have to right-click in
order to see those files. This results in me having to click a lot. Suggest
this becomes a ‘setting’ in the preference section allowing users to choose
which experience they want instead. Making simple changes to the UX like this
(after users have been using it for months, can add a lot of frustration).

I’m after using it a while now and must say have become used to the new
interaction. However I do think that (bar any technical roadblocks) a delayed
popover would work as well and remove the click. In that case it would have to
be reactive when you mouse away from the popover so that it closed when you
were not hovering the list, something that not always happened with the
previous implementation leaving UI in your apps covered over… which was my
main issue with the initial implementation.

I would like to have some way to see that there are pending notification in
the app without having to switch to it.
Either by having the taskbar item flash or by displaying a red dot or
something, similar to how Skype works.

Having to alt tab constantly just to make sure I didn’t miss any message in
slack/chatwork is not very efficient at all. Also many similar apps (Franz,
Wavebox, Rambox) all have such an option, and it is a shame that Station falls
behind for such a critical function.

My request is for Windows, but I assume other OS users would enjoy such a
feature as well.

What I would say is that DND mode basically supresses all the popups while the
dot is still appearing when something happens.
But in all honesty, I don’t really care too much about the implementation, as
long as the app gets a dot in Do-Disturb mode, I can finally start using it.

The issue I’m facing is …

I can’t click and move it around on my screen. Ex. When I need to see
something behind it or move it over a little bit, it feels like Station is
glued to where it is on my screen. I have to shut it down or not use it. And I

Not sure if this is helpful but, on Mac, the foolproof way of always grabbing
the window is bringing your cursor to the top edge until you get the double
vertical arrows, as if to vertically resize it. Instead of dragging up or down
(which does resize the window) drag left or right to move Station. The same
works for the left and right sides—instead of dragging left or right, which
resizes horizontally, briefly drag up or down and it will “release” the window
to be moved around. It’s dumb that I’m even having to post this but it does
work. Not sure if Windows is similar or not.
I get the impression that the Station people intend for the app to be used in
a dedicated, full-screen mode rather than as a window. But sometimes you just
need to drag and drop or see other stuff. Stupid.

There’s very little room to drag and more the station app window. Would be
beneficial if you made that space larger or perhaps make the left side bar
move the window (where there isn’t an app icon).

I also find it tedious to move the Station window on the Mac. It would be nice
to have the option to turn on the title bar, even if it meant giving up a bit
of screen real estate (I’m running on a 27"" iMac attached to a 27"" 4K display,
so I’ve got real estate to spare).

On a side note, I use the wonderful [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) app
to move and resize windows…and it doesn’t work reliably with Station for some
reason. I expect that the non-standard window is one of the reasons. It works
fine with almost every other app I use on my Mac.

I think the concept of Station is genius. As someone who regularly has a
million windows open whilst running a thousand different packages and still
can’t find anything it’s perfect. Thank you. I appreciate it is very much in
development still but I must agree with some of the comments here. The side
bar is tiny and squashed and then there is a huge space that could actually be
holding my apps. I’d like to be able to move my apps where I want them to be
rather than being forced to put them on a tiiny side bar. Generally I’d just
like to be able to customimse it more. It feels like you’ve gone so far but
not quite finishe.d . It’s beauitful. Dont’ stop, let us all make it more
beautiful for ourselves. Also, I think it wodul be greazt if we could make

Hi, I am using an external monitor that is bigger than the screen of my

Don’t fully close the app on close

Station should behave as most Mac apps; don’t “kill” the app when closing the
app using cmd+W or clicking the upper left red icon. For example, Slack is
made with Electron, like Station, and does it already. When closing the app,
it should stay live in the background, otherwise when you open it again, it
has to reload everything.

The main advantages for me are:

   Speed up, constant notifications, lower CPU usage since it won’t be opening all the time, etc.

SUMMARY
Your need in one sentence

As a user I want to keep Station open in the background unless I explicitly
quit so that when I close the window, the background processes and
notifications are still running and can be instantly restored.

GIVE US CONTEXT
Tell us about the current experience

When I click the close button, it exits Station, so that I lose all my
notifications and background tabs.

PROVIDE DETAILS
Tell us what you are looking to change

I’d like the close window button mapped to CMD-H on MacOS instead of CMD-Q

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT
How would it change your experience

The main advantages for me are:

   ability to reload Station instantly
   ability to keep notifications coming in even Station is “closed”

Currently it is not normal behavior unlike other applications, It would be
really perfect if the click on close, hide the application instead of closing
it completely (like all others app on Mac OSX).

+1 It’s easy to say “well then keep it open” but that takes up room on my
desktop or taskbar, and is MUCH easier said than done. I have a habit of
closing my chat apps. I keep closing Station once I’m done messaging someone,
sometimes without even realizing it. Then I miss important messages because
it’s not open. This is extremely frustrating, and honestly I feel like we
shouldn’t have to be requesting a taskbar icon — it should have been standard
from the start.

Station is incredible and capable of so much, but this lack of basic
functionality makes it very unappealing.

When looking at apps on both the web & in station I get a lot of text overlap.
Could someone take a look at this, it can get hard to read apps.

This happens 100% of the time I view it.

I use Firefox Quantum 66.0.3 (64 bit) but I assume that the station app runs
on something else as well. I’m also running windows 10 version 1803.

Resizing makes 0 difference so it must be how the page is setup/loads.

My resoulation is 1920x1080.

It’s sorta okay in the beginning of the web browser but gets worse as you
browse further down.


And is considerably worse in the station app. Then it becomes near unreadable.

I have a few suggestions to Station compared to its competitor Franz.

  1. Icons on the left sidebar are way too small, so are close, minimize, maximize buttons.

  2. I cannot use command+W to close the window, this is really inconvenient! It makes me switching between Station and Franz.
  3. Why does Station choose not to use the system notification centre and build its own? I don’t like the feeling of having two notification centres. It just not “centred”.

I have the same issue

The only reason I stopped using Station is because of the icons. I cannot
differentiate each logo (also because the colors are all the same when it’s
not focused), it takes me effort to recognize the logo and click it. Nobody
wants this hassle.

I am uninstalling until this is addressed, have a look at Franz, their Icon

I would not choose this, as the colours would be a distraction to my focus,
when I stop on an application to do some work.

My approach is to arrange the apps in order with most used at the top. Then I
make good use of the Ctrl-TAB to swap between the last two apps - after that I
will go hunting (by icon) or by Command-T to search for the app or a
particular ‘file’ within it.

I had a quick go at designing what a top/bottom bar might look like. Just a
quick sketch. It could just as easily be on the bottom as on the top, and you
could allow the user to pick.

The thought here is that the tab bar changes when you switch applications. I’m
thinking that CMD+1-9 would switch applications, as it does today, whereas
CTRL+TAB/CTRL+SHIFT+TAB would navigate the tabs.

The main drawback I see with this is that it does interfere more with the
operating systems navigation, at least if you keep it on the bottom (Windows
menu and OS X dock). Also you can’t change into a different open Trello board
with a single click; the tabs are application specific, but this is not
possible today either. A focus on keyboard driven swapping, via search, will
however solve that problem.

I find that in Chrome I would have multiple instances of Google Drive,
Basecamp, etc. open, grouped for different tasks. If I think about a single
task, the number of open tabs will probably always be under 10 tabs.

For me, the best would be to have a dock in Station where in the main dock, or
the top, or somewhere, I can click on a ‘bubble’ that represents a task. In
that bubble, I can arrange my apps and multiple instances of apps. When I
switch to another task/bubble I have different apps/instances of apps, etc.

This way it would perfectly fit in a lift vertical dock, which I would also
prefer, because I always have enough width on my screen, but never enough
height

I think the tabs experience makes a lots of sense for applications like Google
Drive where you work with multiple documents at some time. That’s the natural
evolution for the subdock.

However, we want to make sure that the interface does not get crowded, even in
the Google Drive. That’ a risk: that users opens tabs one after an other, and
we end up with the same situation than on browser. Do you think of a solution
where users don’t have to clean tabs.

For what applications the tab experience makes sense? and for what it does
not?

As a food for thoughts, Windows 10 approach is very interesting:

5de13e924d88ec6dd511bb76,"Thinking about the design of Station

As with the browser today, you run the risk of people opening many tabs. I
think however that this should be up to the user to solve. I know some users
actually like having something as outrageous as 50-100 tabs open, because they
know where things are. Deciding that having many tabs open is ‘bad’, might be
projecting our taste and way of working onto other users, which might not be
helpful.
Also, I think since the tab bar would be specific to each application, it is
already better than the current situation with tabs in the browser.

I can understand that maybe the initial thought with Station was to ‘get rid
of’ all the tabs in the browser, but I believe the issue isn’t binary. I think
the issue with the tabs aren’t the tab interface itself, but that you are
mixing websites with work, they are unordered, so your tab bar might look like
this: an app, three websites, an app, two websites etc. Some of these issues
were mitigated when browsers allowed you to pin tabs. That way you pin the
apps you used the most, and some of the problems were solved. Now you had
visual control over your apps, and keyboard shortcuts such as CMD+1-9 started
to make sense again. The thing was, however, when you CMD+clicked links within
the apps, to open in new tab, these would become unordered again, and not be
part of the app. I think many of the issues exist exactly here: there is no
segmentation of applications into workspaces, which an application specific
tab bar might solve.

Regarding which applications it make sense for, I think it’s really hard to
define. I think that in general it is very circumstantial. Some times it might
make sense to open something in a new tab, other times not. Nearly all my work
is done through (way too many) web applications, and I general I wouldn’t be
able to clearly define which applications require tabs and which do not. I for
instance had multiple tabs for Trello (different boards), multiple tabs for
Slack (different teams). Rather, it might be easier to say which applications
I did not have multiple tabs for: Google Calendar and Inbox.
I think that if one were to implement a tab bar, it would have to be available
to all applications, since if there are multiple different interfaces it can
not only become confusing as to which have a tab bar and which do not, but it
might also prove impossible to define which applications need one, and which
don’t.

That Windows 10 example is really neat. The idea of linking tabs together
rather than force tabs to be part of the same application makes a tonne of
sense since for example my three Slack teams have less in common with each
other than the work I’m doing for them.
I’m curious what happens if you open a document attached to two separate
parents… does it update live, or move the tab to the new window, or something
else…?

Tabs in Station seem like an old solution to a new problem. I don’t think of
things I’ve opened in Station as “open” per-se after I’m done using them. I’m
assuming Station is quietly killing them in the background and bring them back
when I need them. This means I’ve never closed a tab, just moved on to the
next thing—much like iOS multi-tasking.

Certain cases, for instance a drive, I see the value in quickly being able to
switch between multiple open files… but maybe I picture it more like a file
structure in an IDE like opening a Project, which I guess is what Windows 10
Sets are trying to be.

A dark mode would be perfect! But if it can’t be implemented in house, then
the application of an “extension” to all of these webpages might be possible

First of all, I love Station, and am grateful that you work diligently to make
awesome updates. This is part UX/UI and feature request, but since it is
mainly UI based, thought it best here.

When an update is available, the icon on the sidebar constantly flashes until
you update. I understand that you want users to update as soon as possible.
However, I may not want to update right at that time, or maybe later in the
day, and in the meantime I am bombarded with the flashing icon.

I am requesting one of two things: 1.) A setting that would turn this off (not
as ideal) or 2.) Remove the flashing and just have the icon glow or have a
color. This way I know that an update is available, but it doesn’t give me a
headache until I actually do make the update.

Thanks again for a great app.

Hello [@JonathanBelle](/u/jonathanbelle),
As Diego mentioned it, you have to drag the Station app in your Applictions
folder.
If you are on Mac, the icon you still see on your dekstop must be the
installer that you don’t need anymore and can throw in your trash.

Tell me you need another information!

This is the number one frustration for me hands-down. It would be great to
have some control on the behaviour.

I have 3 email accounts and the popup window that’s triggered on hover of the
icon is always (always) in my way. I’d love to disable it / set the hover to
instead only show on-click if that app is already active. (I rarely have
multiple windows open per app, but when I do I would imagine I’d need a way to
show that.)

(I fear even adding a close button honestly would make the window still get in
the way if it remains a hover trigger.)
