I was looking back and just realized I had posted this in the wrong place so
re-posting on the proper thread. Also, my post was so long  here is the TL;DR:

  1. Make it possible to close an open (google doc) tab with the keyboard: Cmd+W
  2. Let me switch between multiple google docs with the keyboard: Cmd+[ whatever number is google docs ]

  

This new feature has been awesome (quick switch w/ google docs). It’s now
making me really want to be able to switch between open google docs using the
keyboard.

Cmd+[1-9] is such a powerful shortcut. My recommendation for switching between
tabs within an app is to make it work just like Cmd+Tab does on Mac. For
example:

Cmd+6 takes me to my Google Drive, it shows me whichever doc I was most
recently viewing.  
Now, imagine I press Cmd+6 again while already viewing Google Drive. This
should toggle to the second-most-recent doc I was viewing.  
If I press Cmd+6 then let go of 6 but keep holding Cmd it shows me the flyout
of all the open docs, I can press 6 over and over again while holding Cmd and
it will cycle through them. When I let go of Cmd it selects it.

Just like Cmd+Tab. The key with Cmd+Tab is that once you’ve selected a new
app, your previous app becomes the second-most recent. This way Cmd+Tab lets
you always conveniently cycle between your last two apps. Likewise, Cmd+6
would let me always cycle between my two most recent docs.

Anyway, just a suggestion to take this feature to the next level! This seems
to matter more for Google Drive than any other app because it’s the app where
you inevitably end up with lots of open sub-tabs.

Oh, I also want to be able to close an open Station app tab with keyboard
shortcut. You should also support this with Cmd+W. This would close the
current open app, and likewise you could support this with the Cmd+6 cycling.
I do this all the time with Cmd+Tab. For example, when I want to close a bunch
of running Mac programs I press Cmd+Tab, let go of Tab but hold Cmd. Tab
through a couple times to get to the right app but I still don’t let go of
Cmd, instead I tap Q and it closes the app. It’s awesome to be able to close a
bunch of Mac apps without needing to switch to them, likewise for closing a
bunch of Station Google Drive tabs.

Hey guys,

This is a great feature that I would love to us, but I can’t get it to work.
Searching for channels does not return any of my channels in the quick switch.

I am on High Sierra, 10.13.15. Station version is 1.16.0.

I tried removing slacking and adding it again, as well as restarting Station,
but neither worked

In version 1.17.0, we improved the relevancy of the results shown, even for
the first usage (Quick-Switch is learning from using it to show the most

Also we are taking into account nicknames in Slack and removing deleted users

I’ve been enjoying it but it does seem to be missing private Slack channels.
Also, it would be helpful if it could identify which Slack team the channel is
in. For example, I have the same person in two of my Slack teams but we only
really communicate in one of them–I want to know which team I’m switching to.

Hi [@isaiahfranco](/u/isaiahfranco), thanks for your feedbacks.

Indeed private slack channels are not yet accessible but we will add them
soon. And good point on the ability to see which Slack team a contact is from,
we’ve already designed it and will implement it in the V.2 coming soon!

Biggest deal-breaker for me it the inability to use Cmd+T to quickly switch
between channels/private messages. Slack is my bread and butter at work. Will
have to remove from Station until this is resolved.

Brief description of the issue

The quick-switcher should allow me to spotlight search (in a way) with
different apps I have integrated, right? For example, I’m on another app and I
have to DM someone on Slack. I should be able to type in their name from the
quick-switcher, hit enter, and that would take me right to their DMs on Slack.
I’ve been using Station for a couple days and so far it only worked properly
on one day, which is really odd.

You answer “no” to “Are results relevant?”. What do you actually see? And what
do you expect?

> You duplicate the content with the items that we have in the bar, the

To be sure. What do you call the “bar”? Is that the Quick-Switch opened via
`Cmd+T` or the Dock (left panel)?

Mmmmh in fact, duplication is what you will see on the screenshot. 2 times the
same app.

You have access to all your instance in the menu “bar” on the left. If you do
a cmd+t you will go back to the last screen you visited

What’s the added value to repeat this information, I mean the last app I
visited there? If you would like to keep this history track, make it more
discret or the possibility to active or not the option… Like when you hold the
back on you browser, you will have the drop down and see the last page
visited.

It does work for me. I’m on Windows 7 and version 1.30.0.

I’m the kind of person that really likes to avoid using the mouse at all cost,
so this is actually useful for me. The shortctuts for ctrl+1-9 are useful but
are only limited to the first 9; then the ctrl+t menu is the best option but,
unfortunately, it is quite uncomfortable to use compared to the limited one
offered by using ctrl+tab.

Although it has certain problems. Unless I want to change to the most recent
tab used I have to hold the ctrl key which can be tiresome. Not only that but
the Esc button to close it doesn’t work because the ctrl+Esc is a combination
that already exists in the OS; just realeasing ctrl is not an option because
it forces me to switch to another tab, it just does not let me stay in the
same tab.

The only thing I really liked about it was the key combination to use it.
Having to hold ctrl to use it, not being able to use the arrow keys, not
allowing me to stay in the current tab, nor allowing me to write a different
tab from my recent ones just makes it feel like a downgrade from ctrl+t.

tldr; Please add an option to disable the subdock and recent icon.

DETAILS  
My use case for Station is simple: Click an icon and switch to one of a dozen
communication apps/interfaces and therefore I/my users find both the subdock
and recent icon/sublists “in the way” of performing our primary objective.

   The subdock includes settings/options unnecessary for Station’s core functionality and adding these “benefits” blocks a critical chunk of the screen without adding value to my users (literally covering the content they want to see).
   The “recent icon” takes a space that users could use for an app which could reduce long lists/icon scrolling.
   Obviously I haven’t performed any real testing, but assuming a user has less than a full column (probably a large majority of Station’s users?), making the mental connection that “I’m looking for the last app/icon I used in Station earlier today” then going to the top of the column (a new place for that icon) to find and click on it, seems like it would require more of a cognitive load then just clicking on the icon they’re looking for (which is where their mind and muscle memory knows it’s always been).

Appreciating some people desire the added functionality of the subdock and
“recent icon/lists,” my personal ask is before going further down this rabbit
hole, for the love of good UX, add options in Station’s core preferences to
turn these distractions off!

   Inability to disable the subdock was why Station failed my initial round of testing… I came back because of your great selection of app extensions – and would love to both stay and recommend Station to my clients but the inability to disable the subdock is teetering on deal-breaker.

… Just my 10¢ (2¢ adjusted for inflation)

Can I turn that off?

My problem is that it takes up valuable real estate and I’v hit it
accidentally several times meaning to hit the icon that usually sits in that

I am not a fan of the “Recents” item in the dock. I don’t use it, and it take
a prominent space in the dock that I would prefer to reserve for my most
frequently used app. Plus, with this extra icon in my dock, I now have to
scroll in order to see the apps at the bottom of my dock.

Please allow us to disable this.

It’s a neat feature, and I could see it being useful for someone with more
apps than I use, or for saving a keystroke or so for someone who switches
among a handful of apps using the keyboard a lot.

Putting the icon at the top of the list instead of the bottom and making the
subdock appear on mouse-over instead of click are both excellent ways to make
the new feature stand out and get feedback.

However, combined with the fact that it looks as if one of my app icons has
just migrated to the top of the list (but doesn’t behave that way), the
result is that my immediate reaction to it was to try to look up how to
disable it or at least move it to the bottom of the panel, and I may try to
figure out how to hide it using the Station developer tools since there don’t
seem to be any relevant options for it yet. That’s how irritating it is.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that pressing Ctrl+Tab twice doesn’t always go back to the same
2 programs. Also, there’s only a max of 4 programs in the quick switch
Recents, and the actual last one doesn’t show up

NOTE: this does work on my Dell computer but not my Razer computer, both have
Windows 10 and version 1.30.0

  

Mandatory details

   Trigger — ctrl+tab

   Issue — last program isn’t there

I’m honestly not a fan of this new implementation. To be honest, I never use
quicklinks anyway, since I have either the mouse to use, or hotkeys of cmd+
(number), it doesn’t really get any faster than that for me.

Additionally, it gets in the way at the top there, and I can find myself
clicking on it by accident more often than I’m happy doing. It also just looks
bad when it displays, for example, the Twitter logo. It’s just not a good look
all-round as far as I’m concerned.

That said, I can see the benefit for some people. I can see that it’s a really
good function for people…but not all people. In light of that (and something
I’ve thought of before you even implemented this new approach), is why not
simply allow people to disable it via toggle if they see no need for it. To
force people into using a function that is both useless AND gets in the way of
some people, is just poor UX implementation.

I know it sounds like I’m whining about something…honestly, I’m not. But, for
me, it was a useless function to me before, and now it’s both useless AND
getting in the way (functionally and visually).

Thanks

agreed that there should be an option to disable the recent dock icon; it does
get in the way; even better, maybe move it to the bottom of the sidebar
instead of the top so it’s clearly separate from the rest of the programs

I like the new Ctrl + Tab switch, it’s not in the way anymore, so it doesn’t
interfere with the mouse as it used to for me. It’s much faster () to trigger
! It’s a much better implementation that the Ctrl + T pop-in you had.

The look and feel is great, although I realized after some time that I only
use the : switch to last content (app or page or section within app) option.
But I use it A LOT! I very seldom switch back 2 contents or more. I never use
the recent content list with my mouse.

I find the new recent dock icon convenient somehow as it helps me confirm
where i’ll switch back to. But I understand some people would like to hide it
as it takes one extra app space on top)

I had issues on my first sessions with Ctrl + Tab: some apps would not appear
in the list (win 10, v1.30). After restarting station it seems to have gone.
I’ll report back if it happens again (it’s super annoying, so I won’t miss it
if it does  )

My two cents on possible improvement: maybe you should merge the switch app
and search into the magnifier button. Why couldn’t magnifier be used to find
recent apps? For those who like and use that feature, it could make sense too…
What do you think ?

Station 1.30.0 on Mac responds very slow when switching between apps/extension
and i believe the quick-switch is to blame. Did not have this issue with
previous releases. This is especially bad when switching to android messenger,
whatsapp and skype.

Hi [@Georges](/u/georges),

I followed the steps you provided in “How can I get a fresh start on my
Station.” When I opened Station, it did delete all of my applications and
asked me to re-sign in. After going through the process of signing in, picking
new apps, as soon as it loaded all of the apps, the Quick Start notification
came back and I’m back to the same locked screen, unable to do anything. Any
other ideas? Thanks!

I for one, like the feature a lot! I am a shortcut user so I hardly even
noticed that the icons shifted. I use the cmd+1-9 keys all day, and when
switching back and fourth between apps works well for me if it’s one of the
apps I use regularly enough to know its number. ctrl+tab works much better for
that. Great improvement.

I can understand how people would not like the location of the icon, and it
certainly doesn’t need to be there as far as I’m concerned. The only time I’m
going back and fourth between 2 apps, I’m well aware of which apps those are,
so there’s no need for me to see the most recent app up at the top. It also
doesn’t work so well when you have custom icons for Slack. My “most recent”
app right now is the Slack icon, but I don’t even have the Slack icon in my
Station, I have my own Slack icons, so that’s kinda weird.

View -> Toggle Station developer tools -> select an element to inspect it ->
experiment with styling. Unfortunately I think it has to be done whenever you
relaunch Station, but at least it’s possible.

My suggestion is to find the div with the class `appcues-subdock-recent`,
which will also have a classname of c followed by some numbers (mine is c0121;
I don’t think it’s autogenerated and subject to change, but I’m not sure). I
changed the `height` of the .c0121 class to 0px instead of 30px. This caused
the icon to disappear and I can’t mouse over it anymore, but the CTRL+TAB
keyboard shortcut still works if I want to use it.

On the bright side, this feature and how invasively it grabbed my attention
has let me to discover that the CTRL+T quick switch is way more useful to me
than I’d realized!

The quickswitch indicator thing in the top left under the search bar shows me
profile pictures from my last used conversations on slack and -so- many people

Station, and then hunt for the tab with the notification.

Hi [@flashbacker](/u/flashbacker), Station stores its cache the same as
Chromium.  
The cache folder location depends of your OS:

   MacOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Station/Application Cache/Cache
   Windows: %appdata%/station/Application Cache/Cache
   Linux: ~/.config/Station/Application Cache/Cache

Once you’re there, the files are not readable as-is, and Chrome doesn’t even
have a view anymore to see those files (so neither do we).  
The only tool I could find is this one:
<https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chromecacheview.html>  
but I haven’t tested it.

Hope you’ll get your files back!

Bonjour,

Je ferai de mon mieux pour éclairer ta lanterne.  
Cette conversation est très ancienne et j’imagine que vous avez déjà
abandonné, mais si jamais Station vous intéresse encore, ou bien si jamais
quelqu’un d’autre est intéressé par la plateforme, ma réponse pourra peut-être
aider.

Station n’est pas censé être un nouveau navigateur, c’est un logiciel capable
de garder tous vos services/applis sur une seule page (ie je peux utiliser
Slack, Messenger, Gmail, Drive, tout à partir du même logiciel).

La version actuelle permet de retirer une application très facilement: il
suffit de cliquer sur l’icône, la petite roue de paramètres, qui amène au
panneau de configuration de Station, et sur la droite au niveau du nom de
l’appli, il y a une petite icône de poubelle qui permet de retirer l’appli.

Je tiens à préciser que pour une utilisation optimale il est important
d’utiliser les raccourcis clavier!

En ce qui est de la lenteur de l’ordinateur, je n’ai moi pas eu cette
expérience. Je suis toutefois sur Linux et cela pourrait affecter votre
expérience, mais je pense que globalement l’expérience s’est beaucoup
améliorée depuis ces 6 mois !

J’espère que cela aura pu vous aider.

PS: vous avez poster votre message dans la mauvaise section!

From this discussion

retrieve the user credentials. Can you talk about this a bit further?

Without more details, I am (and would advice other Station users to be)

the information entered into the “Connect 1Password” form is not being stored

When I add 1Password integration to Station, do you transmit my secret key and

They have, and I must say I’m flummoxed. It’s not promising. The Station team

Hi [@pavelkroupa](/u/pavelkroupa) [@ClementDufour](/u/clementdufour)
[@akbar25](/u/akbar25) Thanks for raising those important questions.

Question 1 : I actually can’t think of any other use case than the ones
provided on these bullet points. Then clearly the use of “May include” is
confusing and I will update our Privacy Policy accordingly. The only reasons
why we would use your data is either to:

  1. assist you in any way possible (ex: knowing your version of the app or the apps you use can help us debug an issue you may be facing)
  2. in order to help us decide on what to build next (ex: we see many users installing application X in Station therefore we prioritize building a better integration of this app over others)

Question 2 : Yes. I can give you a very concrete example from no later
than yesterday: we used Amplitude (an analytics tool) in order to understand
which application did users switch the most to using the Quick-Switch feature.
We wonder how we could improve the Quick-Switch feature but for that we need
to understand what people use it for. I understand “market insights” is a
strange term as it resonates as if we were generating reports for people
outside the company. We do not. This data is used internally only in order to
figure out how to improve existing features or what to build next.

Question 3 : Yes very good question. We use a tool call Segment (you might
know) that allow us to easily plug our database to other SaaS services that
need user data in order to function. Here are 2 very concrete examples:

   [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com) : we use Intercom in order to communicate with our users via email. But sometimes we want to send an email only to the users of version X or users that used a specific feature because it is more relevant to them. Intercom gets data such as last time a user was active, the app version etc. in order to help us email the right users.
   [Appcues](https://www.appcues.com/) : we use it in order to create the onboarding tooltips you must have seen the first time you used Station. Those tooltips can be triggered based on a set of actions taken by the user. If you haven’t used the Quick-Switch functionality for instance then Appcues needs to know this in order to send a tooltip to introduce the feature. If you’ve used the Quick-Switch, that tooltip is useless for you, hence Appcues won’t show it.

I insist on the fact that Segment and the third-party tools we feed data in
are GDPR compliant. If tomorrow you ask us to delete all your data, it will be
removed across all those third-party applications, not just our database.

I hope this answers your questions. I tried to be as detailed as possible as
we’ve got nothing to hide. Thanks for your questions as they helped us improve
our Privacy Policy once again and make them clearer for you guys.

Please do not hesitate to hit us with more questions on this! We do not take
it lightly considering the fact that you indeed use many of your applications
through Station. It’s natural you wonder what happen to that information. As
Peter Parker said: with great power comes great responsibility.

","

[@akbar25](/u/akbar25) Good question. In order to know if down the line our
position on data collection will change equals to asking what our future
business model will be. Either we chose to charge users / companies for it or
we decide to keep it entirely free and generate revenue from advertising. We
firmly believe in the former option.

We are currently working hard to build collaborative value for entire
companies, and ultimately we’d be able to charge for that value we’ve created.
I am very confident we can succeed and our entire roadmap is geared towards
that objective.

We are building Station so we have companies pay for the product, rather
than be the product.

As for your second question: yes, we would definitely update our privacy
policy if that was to change and you would all be made aware of what exactly
is changing.

Hope that answers your question.

in fact I have verified that the problem affects all new appimage format
release applications. But there is a solution to solve the problem: the use of
The Assassin Appimage Launcher. The debian installation file (bionic) for use
with Ubuntu is also available. Once the package is installed, it takes care of
the first launch, without needing to make the appimage package executable, to
start the application in an extemporaneous or integrated way. If you choose
the second option, the appimage package is moved to the “Applications” folder
within your home, it is made executable, it is inserted in the menu with its
icon. Appimage Launcher also allows, through contextual menu, to update and /
or remove the chosen appimage. It works very well.

Oh! I checked for updates and this new version appears

but when I quit to install the new version, the app does not open again. When
I manually open the app, the previous version appears:

You are right. Also because the update should replace the previous release
(1.51.1) with the current one (1.52.2) and this does not happen. I removed the
previous version via Appimage Launcher and downloaded the next one. But this
should happen automatically while, at least with my Ubuntu version, no update
function appears in the context menu.

It would be nice if I could see the requests for apps that I have made. I feel
like the request just goes into a black hole.

The even better goal would be a list of requested apps with a vote count for
each of them… that way I would also be able to vote for new apps/extensions.

I’m new here, so maybe this already exists, but I haven’t found it. sorry in
advance if that is the case.

Hi [@pthomsen](/u/pthomsen) ,

Actualy this would be a great adition to the “Add apps and extensions” page.  
maybe you could request it in [Feature
requests](https://community.getstation.com/c/features-request)?  
This way the community can vote for this idea  
You certainly have my vote

When i see your interview on french actuality channel, i move quickly on your
web site for download your solution ! But after 2 day… I decide to uninstall
it for now… And hop your solution become better un the future.

Why i decide to unstall it (not a troll, juste for your information :)) :

   No Other languages supports (Your are french project, support french and english would be nice…)
   For starting to use your solution, you ask me a google account…  yes the gsuite is verry nice solution for business today but a lot of compagny stay on microsoft solution… No possibility to log in with office 365 is cripping for use it on my Business compagny.
   I decide to use my personnal gmail adresse. But i can’t use only one on “Station”. A lot of people have 2 email account ore more… No possibility to use many account isn’t possible for a business or personnal solution.
   Sorry for that but Office 365 intégration is realy bad…All the pages open on an external browner… No possibility to add separtly sharepoint access and some othe offices 365 applications…  .
   In business compagny, we use a lot of “self hosted” web-applications. Or you never can offer support for all web applications on the world. (Not quickly). So possibility to add only a favorite web page browner can be a good solution to add “web-application” manualy when you doesn’t support it yet hould be nesssary.
   For finish, you have same issues than the other “all in one app” solutions. But you doesn’t offer us the possibility to fix it himselft… For exemple… The microsoft teams error login page. Look this issue on rambox <https://github.com/saenzramiro/rambox/issues/1354>. For waiting a patch on the next version by the developper, we have a solution to change the “user agent” for this app. In business, it’s not possible in business solution to doesn’t have a “quick fix”…
   No possibility to add password manager than “dashlane” (come one ! it’s an other french solution :)). Lot of compagny use oassword manager for sharing access to they user without give use the passewords. (<https://www.dashlane.com/fr/business>)

Sorry for my english, i try to give you my opinion in english, but i’m better
in french ^^.  
Good luck for the future, i come back at the end of the year to see your news
releases. For now, i stay on the open source solution rambox for my business
compagny. But you can make a verry good solution for business in the future
i’m sure. But today it’s more a beta or alpha version (for business compagny)
than a “ready to use” app.

After using Station for about 5 months I have decided there are too many bugs
to continue daily use. I find myself back to my browser more often than not to
access unsupported and/or buggy apps.

Heavy Microsoft Teams user - was working originally, no longer works.  
Heavy Desk user - never worked.  
Submitted posts about these two during first month of use - no movement on a
fix.

Notifications continue to show inaccurate information including a picture for
someone not associated with the app the notification came from.

No support for LastPass - really difficult for apps that require login daily.

Office / SharePoint is very buggy - requires re-logging in every 5 minutes.

All in all - Station is a great concept! The product I believe has a bright
future. Which likely means when it finally becomes commercially usable - I
won’t be able to afford it.

Good luck!

Hi there,

First, I love the idea of station. The design and style is great, the apps you
offer work well, and the pricing is killer.

Unfortunately, for now, I’ll have to use a competitor’s app. I wanted to offer
some feedback as to why.

  1. The inability to add custom apps. Nearly every competitor has this feature, and it’s invaluable. I use a small, mostly unknown, company for texting my userbase called Betwext. One of the things I really want is to have this logged in and available all the time, without having a browser open. Unfortunately, because of your design philosophy, you decided not to add custom apps. This hurts your end user, because most of us are using some well-known apps, but also probably have our own smaller or internal apps we use. Without this feature, I had to drop station from my list, which is too bad.
  2. From my experience testing it, station is pretty inefficient with system resources. Compared to 4 other competitors, station came in last place for resources used. It can be slow to load apps, and has a tendency to sort of hang. I’m sure this is something that will improve over time. One thing that would help is a feature some competitors use: suspending resource use on apps that haven’t been touched for a while.

I appreciate the chance to try the software, and will periodically check in to
see how it’s improved. It certainly has a lot of potential, and I hope
eventually it’s something my coworkers and I can put to use.

Thanks!  
James

Hi, I’m CTO of a start-up in Berkeley. I spent 30 minutes assessing Station
for my team. Here are my thoughts.

Firstly, a little about myself. I am a “power user” of computers. I code (and
manage) for a living, so I’ve taken the time to learn all the shortcuts for
Chrome, Mac, PyCharm, Vim, etc…

I prefer using the keyboard to the mouse, because it’s faster and less likely
to injure you over the long term, if you have a decent keyboard. I use the
Kinesis advantage.

Firstly, the reason I was hesitant to even try Station is security. The
Station company seems too small to have the resources to securely build a web
browser. Our entire life gets routed through a web browser, so it’s necessary
that security is top notch. Nothing about Stations marketing suggested it was
secure enough to trust with my Google credentials.

Secondly, station has weak keyboard-only support. While pressing CMD+2 and
CMT+T to navigate between different applications is AMAZING, I needed to be
able to quickly navigate though application windows as well. So adding (CMD +
[) and (CMD + ]) to move between application windows would be great. Also, it
need a shortcut to open new application windows (For Google Drive especially).

I’m excited about this product, and I hope it improves. I’m not going to
switch at this time, but I’m excited about what Station is attempting to
achieve. This isn’t my real email, but you can reach me an
[firstname.lastname@gmail.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@gmail.com)

I’ve just signed up to Shift out of curiosity to compare with Station and in
all honesty, Station has a much better layout, plus tabs by application and
the search feature is a winner for me.

The reason why I was curious about Shift in the first place was because of the
extension functionality, which, in my opinion, is smoother than Station as I
can use Grammarly, Streak and LastPass across the whole app. These features
would crush Shift!! Would be awesome if I could check for updates and also
share my screen via hangouts, Skype and also have the windows compatible to be
able to cast to other screens. One bonus feature would be to be able to hide,
minimise and/or move the dock as it gets in the way when doing design work.

The issue I’m facing is …

First of all, congratulations for Station, it’s something I need for so long.
Today I knew it was realeased almost two months ago, so I want to ask some
issues I’m having to see if they are actually fixable or maybe they would be
future features to include:

   I would like to choose the folder when downloading a file (it happens on Whatsapp).
   When I make click on something that goes to Linkedin, it opens me a new Linkedin tab, even though I don’t have it installed (I’d like this make me go to my browser).
   Mailchimp is not working well to me, when trying to open different tabs, the back-arrow disappear and it’s difficult in general navigate there. :-/
   Finally, I would like to choose individually which apps pop up at my desktop bar, since I would like to receive alerts from Slack and Gmail but not from Whatsapp, for example.

Thank you, keep working hard

   Issue  
Station for teams looks like it’s broken.  
Also, for this to TRULY be useful for us, we NEED the ability to set up
different onboarding for different departments or even individuals. I can’t
have an employee at one level, load 25 apps 10 of which are for senior
management.  
Until that changes STATIOn… is simply a clever idea, one that unfortunately
fails to fire on the necessary cylinders to make it a viable tool for real
life use. (I don’t care HOW many companies you tout use it. It simply is half
baked in its current state.)

Man this product used to be so great and I used it 24/7 but for some reason it
got super buggy/laggy, way too many updates and releases. Google Cal in
particular now hangs every 5 minutes.

There’s no customer service (i can’t find an email or help line to just send a
bloody message to the team anywhere on the site) so this is the only way to
post feedback

I hung in there for the last month hoping it would be fixed but no choice but
to abandon the product now, gonna move to SHIFT app which is hella smooth and
i’m happy to pay for that. What a shame!

[@Georges](/u/georges) \- what’s the impression of the SHIFT app from the
Station Team’s perspective?

I often see ads for SHIFT app appearing in FB. Curiously you both show
“Spotify / DropBox and Airbnb” as clients of your app. Given that 3 clients
are supposedly using 2 very similar app/products within their own
organisation… I would have imagined the “other” product must have been
mentioned?

p.s. just asking from friendly and curious mindset - I’m NOT phishing for any
IP or NDA information
