","Hey [@OlivierdeRegis](/u/olivierderegis)

I’m having a hard time reproducing this bug.  
Could you send me a screen recording of your error so I can identify
reproduction steps and triggers?

This should helps us fix this nasty bug!

Hey.  
I had the same issue.  
Closing and opening Station fixed it.  
I didn’t get a screenshot in time, but it was a Whatsapp message in the
station ‘tab’.

Hey [@DarshanPatel](/u/darshanpatel),
[@AntoineFrancois](/u/antoinefrancois), [@YanivEfraim](/u/yanivefraim),

That’s indeed really weird and I’m having a hard time reproducing this bug.  
Could you tell me which OS and which Station version you’re running?

Also, could you help me identify reproduction steps and triggers by
sending me a screen recording (or screenshots) of the issue?

Thanks a lot

I’m having the same problem after a fresh install on macos mojave ( 10.14
(18A391)) on a macbook pro early 2015. Restarting station isn’t helping.  
I’m having the newest chrome version installed (Version 70.0.3538.110
(official build) (64-Bit)). This bug on a whatsapp integration is happening in
other apps too (saw this on a station competitor app).

I was able to get a screenshot with full details. I was able to use it
yesterday without any troubles.

Restarting station didn’t help what actually fixed the problem was removing
WhatsApp instance all together and add it again.

Also happening here. It was working last night. I woke my system today (Mac OS
Mojave running Station 1.31.0) and was presented with the Chrome 36+ message.
I closed Station and re-opened, assuming a refresh would work, but the issue
remains.

Removing the WhatsApp instance from Station, restarting and adding WhatsApp
afresh does not work.

done differently on my side between now and then is that I set up and logged
in to WhatsApp Web in my browser. When I’ve come back to Station a moment ago,
WhatsApp just opened as normal.

Hi [@Georges](/u/georges),  
I have a found the way to produce the bug.  
i was actually stuck with them as most of the screenshots posted. but after
many times of reset current application, i managed to login back to whatsapp
and the way i get back to the problem was:  
you have to click update WhatsApp as shown screenshot below after login.

After that, the display will be as others have posted which is “WhatsApp works
with GoogleChrome 36+”  
and until now, the reset current application yield no result to get me back to
the working whatsApp.  
hope this helps.

I was stuck before I had the chance to login and update, but I found a
workaround  
Hovering on the whatsapp icon a pane appears: you can click it to open
whatsapp in a separate station window - that’s when you get the chance to
login, and subsequently update.

Having the same issue. I downgraded to 1.31.0 and it worked for like a minute
and then it broke again. Basically I:

  1. Uninstall and re-install Station. Nothing
  2. Removed WApp instance. Nothing
  3. Updated Chrome, clean cache. Nothing
  4. Downgraded Station version. Nothing

Help please!

Hi all - I haven’t scrolled through the entire thread so maybe this has been
mentioned…

I was having the exact same issue for a few days now until I updated the app
which provided bug fixes.

If you go to Settings (Click the cog within each app selection) then click on
General then click ‘Check for Updates’.

This will restart the application and should all be working!

I found solution to make it working…

follow instruction: Click View Menu> Developer > Toggle Page
Developer Tools then here

EDITED: UNCHECK Cookies and Local and Session storage before click
“Clear Site Data”. This means you won’t have to re-scan QR code to login
again. This is solution for temporary only until developer fix the bug.

Since I can’t seem to find any “View Menu” button on Ubuntu (Gnome desktop),
all I had to do was open up the keyboard shortcuts page (CTRL + H) and find
out the short-cut for the “Page Developer Tools” (CRTL + ALT + I) and then I
could follow alienx2 solution, and it worked like a charm.

Thanks!

The issue I’m facing is that my Slack & Whatsapp show a white page.  
It happened after downloading a PDF file in slack.  
I’ve restarted both the app and my Mac (High Sierra).  
Opened the developer tools and cleared cache. When I cmd + R in whatsapp, I
see the green bar loading but then nothing happens.

Other apps work as expected. The “native” slack & whatsapp apps on my mac
still work.  
Anybody have an idea?

Missive is my primary app in Station. It has been a couple of weeks where
Missive will not load and I have not used Station in that time as I have had
no time to troubleshoot yet need access to Missive daily.

I have removed and re-added Missive with no change. Missive works everywhere
else (desktop app, Chrome desktop instance, chrome browser, Brave, Firefox,
multiple Android devices) but not in Station.

Was working previously. Unsure what to try next.

I’m having a hard time reproducing this bug on my side.  
Could you help me identify reproduction steps and triggers :

   When you’re stuck on the blank page, could you “Toggle Page Developers Tools” and send a screenshot of your console? (like this: <https://cl.ly/saVu>)
   When you’re stuck on the blank page, what is the current page’s URL? (how to find it: <https://cl.ly/sape>)
   Does double clicking on the app’s icon in your dock solve the issue? (like this: <https://cl.ly/sZ6Y>)

I had this same issue here. The first time I logged in everything was fine,
but after I turned my computer off and opened the app again none of the
integrations loaded. I tried to download a PDF through Microsoft Teams too.
Maybe it is related with the problem.

Hey [@Georges](/u/georges),

I was facing this problem today, but could resolve the issues by double
clicking on the app’s icon in my dock.

I can reproduce my problem by restarting the station. I would say that in 90
percent of all cases one app does not start properly. It is not due to a
particular app. It seems to happen by accident. However, the double click does
solve the issue (a simple cmd+r reload doesn’t!).

Here are my outputs for trying to load Google Calendar:

   Console is empty, but html shows:  

   Copied page url is: “about:blank”

I’m facing the similar issue.

Just to add - In my case, when I right click and copy the url it’s always -  
about:blank

With page refresh, there is no activity in Page’s Developer Console > Network
or Console Tab (page is titled `Developer Tools - about:blank`)

Even if I use Detach Current Page, URL is still about:blank

+1 to the people experiencing this, also it’s very often (as in, multiple
times per day).  
For me, I think it could be related to a ‘slow internet connection’, as it
seems to trigger the issue more often. It’s only on the “first load” of the
given app, that it does this.

Also, as mentioned by others in the thread, I too see the “about:blank” when
copying the URL.

Usually I can Cmd + Q Station, and the “app” loads just fine upon startup.

We recently added a “Reset Current Application” feature that should,
hopefully, solve your issue.  
After updating your Station to the latest version (1.20), open the app that’s
stuck, open the “Help” top bar menu and choose “Reset Current application”
(more info [here](https://faq.getstation.com/bugs-and-glitches/how-to-restart-

Me too. Several windows (Gmail and Slack off the top of my head).

Refresh doesn’t help.

Kind of defeats the purpose of Station if I have to load & check every single

The issue I’m facing is …

When I try to add the app “Google Inbox”, Station removes all the apps from
the sidebar and sends to app to Slack. If a click the magnifying glass icon,
it restores it but it doesn’t add Inbox (the behavior is weird and turns Inbox
unusable).

This happened after the latest update (I already reinstalled the app from zero
to see if it was a specific configuration I did, but it didn’t work).

UPDATE:  
With the latest update, now there’s a change on the “add apps”, I can see that
for INBOX, my account is logged in however when I click it the behaviour
previously stated remains, the sidebar goes blank and Station becomes idle.
This really bothers me because I like Station but it’s not 100% useful if I
can’t use Inbox…

Brief description of the issue

Slack gets to the Slack loading screen, but then won’t go any further. I’ve
tried reloading multiple times. Quitting and reloading Station entirely, and
even removing and re-adding the Slack app. Nothing works. I can’t access
Slack!

I think this was incorrectly merged. For one thing, it wasn’t giving a white
screen. I would load the Slack loading screen with our custom quotes to show
during loading. It would even show the loading indicator that would complete,
but then the Slack loading screen would never give way to the actual Slack
interface like it normally does.

I tried the reset application and reload this page options multiple times and
it would not work. I removed and re-added slack multiple times (but it never
had me login again). I even tried force closing it with the task manager.
Nothing worked. I finally couldn’t waste more time waiting for Slack to work,
so I completely removed Station and downloaded it and installed fresh. That
fixed it for now. But I wonder if there’s some other bug here. Maybe more
control (or a single option) to truly, completely reset an app would do it.
But right now the option that’s available isn’t really clearing it, or I would
have had to login again.

I have the same problem as [@Tevya](/u/tevya). Since 1.29 (the “Use-Team-
Logos-as-Icons” update), both my Slacks won’t load anymore, but are stuck at
their loading screens, see below:

This should be fixed in Station’s latest version (1.30.0)  
Could you update your Station and tell us if it’s been solved for you?

To update, just open the preferences (from the “Station” top bar menu) and
click the “Check for updates” button on the right.

Slack is still not loading with 1.30.0, sorry …

(In my case it’s just Slack that’s not loading, everything else, like Google
Mail, Google Drive, Gitlab, Notion, Hangouts, etc.) is loading just fine.)

It looks like the blank screen is gone, but I can’t tell for sure because it’s
doing this crazy strobe effect. I can’t even capture it in screenshot, it’s
that fast. Love Station, but I’m not trying to have seizures!

Okay, deleting the “Station” directory within “Application Support” fixed the
problem, as in: Slack loads again.

But of course this meant having to add all my apps back in, which is
frustrating.

Even more so since Station requires you to “Create an account” and won’t work
without it, but then for some reason doesn’t remember the apps I added to my
setup when I later log back in with the same account. Sorry guys, this doesn’t
make any sense at all.

I think I am going to have to give up on this app. It has been months now and
no updates have fixed the issue of apps not loading (stuck on ""Wait while we
load X. Even the Station App Store gets hung up!), or if I restart Station, it
loads the start page, but nothing is clickable on the page.

I have tried: Closing all the processes, (which just made Station crash),
removing and adding back the apps, (which is harder to do now with the latest
update since the app store stopped working as well and reinstalling station.

I’ve had my fair share of bugs and glitches in new apps, but this is simply
unusable. This needs to go back to Alpha.

My guess is that the Complice people changed their login sequence enough that
the Station login code doesn’t work. It’s not a white screen, it’s just “I get
stuck trying to connect to Complice.” Everything else is working fine for
me.

Creator of Complice here (someone pointed me at this thread).

I did make a small tweak to the login page recently but I don’t think it would
break anything (it was mostly a visual change, and mostly on mobile.)

I’m testing out station for the first time though and I can confirm Complice
isn’t loading (same as what Clark describes). I’m not sure what I can do to
help, since I’m not seeing any details or anything, but maybe some of the
Station folks ([@Georges](/u/georges)?) can let me know if there is something
for me to do!

Looking on my backend, I’m seeing a “Client Request Interrupted” error from
the Heroku router, for a request for the homepage (""/"") around the time that I
open Station. Oh! And some request for the homepage is triggering a 301
redirect. My guess is that at least one of those has something to do with it,
although I just tested that whole thing again and didn’t see either of those
this time.

(I’m on Ubuntu 18.04, fwiw, with station 1.36.0)

Thanks a lot for contributing in spite of the bugs🙏  
We recently focused on improving Station’s performances & CPU usage: your
issues should have been solved since Station v1.4.0 (released the 5th of
February).

Can you tell me you if you feel that Sation is faster after updating to
v1.4.0?  
If you don’t & still experiencing high CPU usage, we’re gonna need 3 files so
we can investigate further.

  1. Your [logs](http://faq.getstation.com/bugs-not-that-we-have-any/facing-a-major-bug-and-find-no-answer-in-this-faq)

Just send me those 3 by direct message & we’ll dig into your issues.

Have an awesome day!

Hi!

I was searching around the threads and wanted to let you know that I was also
experiencing massive battery drain. However, I JUST updated to 1.4. Is this
something that should have been addressed in this version?

Really enjoy using the app, have been doing so on a daily basis. Battery drain
would cause me to consider switching to a browser during travel, which would
be ironic as the single “frame” approach of Station is perfect for the road
warrior trying to stay focused on their work.

Will continue to monitor. Thanks!

As a new user, I have noticed the issue as well. It was unbearable some
versions ago. On 1.8.1 it is better, but keeps constant 25-35% CPU load even
when out of focus.

It is improved from the 80%-100% of other versions, but not enough to make a
tool too use at all times, specially when on battery power.

Hi:  
I find in using Station that many of the distractions have been eliminated.
The proliferation of software/systems in the cloud creates this ram usage, a
blessing and a curse. Is there a way to put apps to ""sleep manually,
especially if we are using them infrequently? That would allow for the
“constantly used” apps to be able to use the ram necessary to get the job
done. Just a thought. Thanks for listening.

I dont know why we would need to do this manually, I thought the whole point
was that Station managed the apps usage so that memory WAS NOT constantly
used?! I just counted and I have 19 Station helpers consuming RAM, I only have
17 apps total, and some of them havent been used in weeks if ever, since they
fall under the apps with other issues like Google analytics, Webmaster Tools,
and Tag Manager. I used to run most of these apps in Chrome Beta which yes
typically consumes a lot of RAM as well. But I use The Great Suspender and
other tabs to keep usage under control…

I love Station but the energy consumption is really over-bearing.

It heats up my macbook so bad and affect performance of the whole device, that
I have to quit the app many many times a day.

Really wish there was a solution to this.

Hi Everyone!  
I have been experimenting with different apps open on my desktop depending on
my work flow for the day. I know this sounds counter intuitive, but I have
found that if I remove the Google apps from Station and run them only in the
leanest Chrome Browser, I have helped balance the load for my Windows Desktop
CPU. My main reason is that Gmail extensions are important for my workflow, so
it was natural to remove it from Station, and sure enough, it slowed down.

So, Chrome for Google, Todoist App, Station, Twitter App. I have 22 Apps in
Station, with most signed out until I use for the day. Personally, I find
Google to be one of the bigger hogs no matter what I do. Do I want everything
all at once available? Ah yes, the “holy grail”, my “everything all at once in
Station”. In the mean time, I have to check my Gmail.  
I share this with you as something to consider while the Station Team
continues grappling with the challenge. All challenges have their ebbs and
flows. Just a thought. Thanks for reading.

Hi I also have the issue of slowness on my Station (Macbook Pro macOS High
Sierra). I’m on Station version 1.9  
The app is getting slower after a while. Restarting the app helps.  
Apps I have in Station:

   Slack
   Google Inbox
   JIRA
   Google Drive
   Google Calendar
   Trello
   ProductBoard
   Zeplin

The slowness is more felt when:

   interacting with the navbar on the left and mostly displaying the list of recent items/favorites
   when clicking on a link opening a drive file (within Station) => very slow

The issue I’m facing is station is slow and eats resources.

to that and you’re dead in the water…

My Macbook battery gets drained and charging takes forever due the “Energy
Impact” of Station. Granted, I have 19+ apps running in Station, but many of
them are idle and used infrequently. My screenshot shows 20.2 as the Energy
Impact but it goes as high as 80+. I removed a few apps and it seems to have
improved things, but it’s currently competing with Firefox for top score. It
becomes a toss up: run more tabs in Firefox or run the same apps in Station.
Not sure yet which will have less Energy Impact as battery life is finite and
needs to be taken into account for us laptop users.

One thing I noticed: The “new version” throbber uses tons of CPU. Electron is
just super sucky in handling these simple animations. I can always tell when a
new Station version is available, because it will eat about 20-40% CPU.
Upgrading fixes it.

For the same reason, it’s important to switch Slack to a channel/chat that
doesn’t have animated gifs or emoticons. Even when not visible, it will eat
CPU.

This is on an early-2015 macbook pro, so maybe it’s a hardware thing.

Just experience the worst memory usage in Station, and I have no idea why it
does it - I was just browsing on Chrome and the whole system was super laggy
and slow, and when I check, I see this. Pretty ridiculous.

So the station processes do not seem to be the issue, it’s Station itself
that’s chugging down CPU. For me it sits idly at 20-50%.

Not sure if it’s a coincidence or not but I relaunched Station so the new
features “sparkle button” didn’t show up any more and the CPU is now down to a
totally acceptable 2-8%. I saw the high CPU usage both with the animated
“update available” button and directly after updating with the “new features”
button.

I’ve noticed that my mac pro started being very slow in saving screenshots
(CMD + Shift + 4) - if before it was instantaneous, now it takes 10 seconds (I
use screenshots a lot for research, so that was really annoying).

After alternating between Franz and Station, I recently come back to Station
again. Unfortunately it seems that the high CPU usage is still not fixed.

The symptoms that I’m seeing is a bit different, yes there is a high CPU
usage, however after leaving it overnight it will actually lock up and I have
to kill it using task manager.

I’m running on Windows 10 with 16GB RAM, should be enough hopefully. The

I just want to chip in. I love station’s concept. It’s just too slow on

to Station, again it will freeze for 10-20 seconds. I use station on full

You could disable background activity if possible for these apps  
This way they are only active when u click on them.

You do this by clicking on settings for the apps  

In the next menu you can disable background activity for those apps that don’t
have to be active all the time.

Station has been really responsive for me until about two weeks ago I’ve had
times when I Cmd-Tab back into the app it is unresponsive for 5-15 seconds.
I’ve also been having random spinups of the fan.

It appears to be Station Helper that comes off the rails.

I am having the same issue and then some.

Mine started with it running very slow switching between apps within Station
and if I was on another screen outside the app then went back to it. It would
take forever or have to refresh it and could tell for about the past 3-4 weeks

My problem is that …  
I’m on a Mac and from time to time and for reasons that I cannot understand,
Station stops working and the screen turns white.

Quitting the application and re-starting brings it back up where it wildly

on my Mac until I quit the app again.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that … The loadtime for the app takes a while, but it’s
understandable due to a lot of apps features which were great. But my major
concerns are, once when i need to switch task or even minimize Station
and come back to work on it again. EVERYTHING has to re-load again which take
around 3 - 5+ secs to load each app. and i have around 12 apps to re-load,
again. If there’s a way to would make it preload in the background that would
help a lot.

I really love Station, all the apps integration, the UX/UI, the simplicity and
usage.  
Please help fix these issue. Would be much more fun to work with it less-
hassle.

Much appreciated. Thanks!

Hey, just chiming in here to say that I also am finding Station nigh unusable
because it takes up so many resources that it starts locking up/crashing my
whole computer. I was willing to wait it out for awhile, but having just been
5 minutes late to conduct a phone interview because I had to do a hard restart
on my computer (and only being able to do the interview at all by pulling up
the questions on my phone and taking notes by hand!) it’s becoming too
disruptive.

Which is a shame, because I love the app otherwise. I use a lot of Google
Docs, and that in particular makes loading times when switching between apps
really long. I like having all those docs under one Drive app on the side, and
being able to star my most used ones, but dang, I just can’t be dealing with
my computer crashing for 40 minutes in the middle of the day.

You can’t use Station and Chrome together. Technically not affordable and

Hi,

Ended up here since Station on my computer is getting to a point that’s
unusable.  
I’m using a Linux OS (Ubuntu 18.04) but it’s pretty much the same issues other
people have.

All of a sudden CPU usage will go to almost 100% (my computer is i7 quad core,
with 16G RAM so it need to be doing something really bad to eat up that much
resource) and the fan will start spinning like crazy. The whole laptop will
freeze for a minute or two before I can get back to my normal activities, and
it seems to be getting worse actually.  
The newer versions will cause the freeze more frequently so I can’t keep it
open even for ~3 hours now.

Quitting Station will immediately reduce resource consumption rate.  
I do hope this will get prioritized and fixed or else I will either have to go
find an alternative or go back to the old ways of doing things.

I’m getting this too. I have 5 processes, probably chrome / electron’s main
processes, then 9 other processes for services. After a long time, the memory
used grows to about 2gb and holds up my CPU. This doesn’t happen on launch.
Seems like there is a memory leak somewhere, either in the webapps themselves
or in the main process.

I understand if the webapps themselves cannot be modified if they have bugs
(since the code for them are hosted on their own domains), but perhaps
implement some kind of webapp state controller. Especially for apps that have
their notifications disabled, they don’t have to run in the background all the
time. Wait for activation by user.

Same goes for terminating some webapps, if notifications are off and not
active for X amount of time.

I just wanted to add to the requests for a fix to this issue

I love using Station, but it has become involuntarily unusable over the last
couple of weeks. It crashes when the memory usage gets too high, and it caused
my whole laptop to crash (blue screen of death) one day last week… which makes
me really uneasy using Station now because of its current unstable status
(every time I hear my laptop’s fans rev up, I get nervous).

   Trigger — using station
   Issue — too many processes, high CPU usage, crashes station and laptop

   RAM — 32GB
   Graphics — 4095MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070
   Station version — 1.35.0

I only have 7 apps active/running in Station (plus 1 google chrome browser tab
open writing this message in the station community), and this is the current
peak CPU/memory usage:

Ps. the fans (which I interpret as the CPU/memory processes) go crazy for
about 5 minutes or so after Station is first launched (either automatically
run when the laptop boots up, or relaunched after crashing).

Hi,

Station crew: I’m quitting Station and moving to a

Wanted to add my voice to this. I very much like Station, but the last while
it’s quite sluggish (haven’t investigated that actual RAM used). And that
despite the fact that I stripped it down to just 5 apps. Before I had twice
that many, and it ran fine. But lately it’s terrible.

Not sure if this was mentioned, but I also get the “beach ball” periodically
while working in Station. Right in the middle of typing an email or Slack
message, it just spins and my typing stalls for a couple seconds, then it
catches up and goes back to normal. It’s only in Station. I don’t experience
this anywhere else on my MBP. And it’s repeated, almost like it’s on a clock.
I haven’t timed it, but it feels like every minute (or something like that) it
does the beachball and I just wait for it to catch up. But it slows me down in
a huge way and is very frustrating.

It’s bad enough I’m looking at switching back to Franz. That’s the app that I
started the journey that led me to Station. But it seemed to be abandoned, and
so that’s why I went looking. Lately it appears to have been resurrected.

This obliviates the last ten seconds of data entry. If it did it once, OK. But
it does it about five to seven times each hour.

It especially does it if I try to select data on a different sheet. So:

  1. I have a formula Sheet 3, and I
  2. Go to Sheet 1 to select data

only happening when I was inserting notes into cells but at present I cannot

am in a sheet the sheet is unreliable and I believe that the issue may have
something to do with Station and autosave. I have noticed that there is a

I have updated to 1.39.1 and I’m still having the same issue. It does not,
however, happen as often. Before it would happen every other time I edited a
cell in Google Sheets. Now it only happens every so often.I am not always able
to make it happen now. I will update to see if it stops altogether.

This is a showstopper, it is impossible to work with a reload every time you
make any changes.

Just downloaded Station and it seems promising, but…

My problem is that when I’m trying to edit a Google sheet within Station, I
get repeated errors saying “Unable to load file”

Basically renders the Drive functionality useless.

I see lots of other people are having similar problems.

Same issue here since 1.38.1. Maybe it’s because of the version bump, maybe
because of a Google update, but this sucks, especially that there’s no
feedback from the devs. Plus no backlog of earlier downloads to at least test
the issue. Duh…

Same here – continuing to get same “Unable to load file” error on sheets and
docs in 1.39.1. This error is rendering Station virtually useless. Please
update the community on the issue and, as suggested previously, give us access
to the last version where this was working properly. Otherwise, I’m done with
you.

This is happening to me as well. Navigating between multiple Google sheets and
inputting data is one of the main reasons why I use Station.  
The worst part for me, is when navigating to a Google Sheet, the sheet says
‘still loading’ for about 2 minutes. This only happens in Station and not with
my browser. The only work around is to not use Station.

I really hope this can get fixed.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that … when I open a Google Doc from within Station while logged
into my G-Suite account, Station will not open the document but instead reads
me an error message. This does not happen when I try to open a Google Sheet
from the same account, nor a doc from another account. It only happens with
Docs from this one account, making it impossible to use Station for the
majority of my Google Drive needs.

Thanks everyone for reporting that bug, we’re working on it.

Our current understanding of the issue:  
Bug description  
When working on Google Sheets, an “unable to load file” prompt is displayed
within the page. It prevents the user from working on his sheet and only a
page reload fixes momentarily the issue, before the prompt comes again.

Trigger  
The prompt seems to be triggered by the autosave feature of Google Sheets but
not on every autosave. Users reports working on sheets from 10 seconds to 2/3
minutes to 10 minutes, before the bug appears and the prompt is triggered. The
delay is not constant between users and we’re not sure what determines the
delay / triggers the bug

soon as possible. please reload this page to continue.”.

If I click ‘ok’ or even press the enter or esc keys, the page reloads and the
error shows up again. This goes on indefinitely. Only way to get out of it is
to press cancel. I’ve reset my computer, quick and re-opened station. Removed
google drive from station and re-added it. Nothing works.

It’s really annoying

Same issue here! Google Docs, Sheet, etc keeps asking me to refresh the page.
Works fine on the browser. The only additional information would be that it
seems to happen only with G Drive documents of a second logged account (I’m
using two integrated Google accounts with Gmail and Drive on Station). The
main one seems to work just ok…

This is basic (OS-level?) functionality that is essential for all sorts of

Add Chrome’s feature of adding shift to the normal paste keyboard combo, to
paste matching the destination formatting.

Another upvote for the pain this causes in GMail using Station on macOS. I
have to keep an editor open, paste in it, select, copy and then paste to GMail
in Station. Really tedious and a pain and it feels especially misleading or
like I’m somehow doing something wrong. If you use the well-known keyboard
shortcut Cmd-Shift-V you see the menu flash quickly signaling you got a
shortcut but nothing happens. When you open Edit and see Paste and Match Style
it makes me think it is implemented but even choosing it from the menu does
not result in the text being pasted.

(MacBook Pro running Mojave 10.14.2)

Yet another vote for addressing this ASAP please! It’s very annoying since
CMD-SHIFT-V (on a Mac) is in my muscle memory now.

@everyone on this thread: There is actually a workaround. You can CMD-V paste
into GMail, then use CMD-\ to remove formatting. It’s still annoying but it’s
less annoying than having another app open.

The intriguing thing about this workaround is that it suggests that in general
Station passes the keyboard command directly through to the Web App, but that
in this specific case Station is intercepting the keyboard command and doing
something with it. That suggests that it should be an easy fix – just remove
the Station code and let the Web App handle it.

Finally, one of the most pettily frustrating things about this is that “Paste
and match style” actually appears as a Station menu command. Since Station has
so few menu commands, you’d think they’d check that all the ones they do have
actually work!

I really thought that I was crazy. On Mac, CMD + V works to paste - however,
CMD + SHIFT + V (paste without styling) is broken. It used to work for me up
until a couple of months ago so I am not sure what is going on. Very, very

I love Station and have been using it for several months. This has slowly been
driving me nuts – I finally looked today to see if there’s a solution. Very
sad to see lots of user concern and zero response from developers on something
that should be simple to fix. Since it doesn’t look like this is getting
fixed, I’m going back to the browser.

I’ve stopped using Station because of the featuring of Plain Text pasting is

hasn’t got it…Please add it in

When using Shopify, it shows that the Chrome version I’m using is outdated and
some features won’t be available. It’s having a hard time loading up the main
admin page. I’ve tried reloading the page, but still comes up.

Is there a way to update the agent separately?

Hey everyone!

Station’s latest release (v1.12.0) is based on Electron v2.0 which embeds
Chrome v61.  
In plain English: you should now be able to login to web apps that
previously blocked Station because of an outdated Chrome.

Thanks a lot for your patience.

Uninstalling your Station and downloading the latest version directly from

Hi folks, any movement on this topic? I run the engineering team at Coda and
we’re getting customers hitting this compatibility issue. I’d request that you
either remove Coda from Station (not my first choice) or ensure you move to
the latest Electron builds to address this issue.

Thanks,

I can see this thread is old and still no solution for Webflow. Webflow is my

Hey everyone

This should be fixed in Station’s version 1.15.  
Could you update your Station then remove / re-add the concerned app and

To update, just open the preferences (from the top bar menu) and click the
“Check for updates” button on the right.

When attempting to add my work Slack account, it routed to my company’s SSO
auth, which was expected. However, when trying to connect it errors out saying
that the Chrome version required is “Latest” and the current version is 10
months old. My local version of Chrome is latest, so this is what makes me
assume it is the embedded Chrome version that is causing the error. I don’t
think I am able to manually update the embedded browser version. See the
included image.

Please advise if there is a workaround, or if the next version can upgrade the
Chrome version.

Thanks!

Initially I was not able to (re-)add the Microsoft Teams app. It continued to
display their unsupported browser message. I was able however to navigate to
Teams from Outlook, and load it properly. Once I had done this, I was then
able to successfully add the Microsoft Teams app in Station, and have it load
without an error message.

Just guessing here, but it seems that when I had removed the app, some data
stayed around which somehow prevented me from adding the app.

Shopify Admin error – your browser needs to be updated.

On visiting Shopify’s website they say “Shopify requires an up-to-date web
browser to make sure that you can use all of Shopify’s features. Shopify
currently supports the latest two versions of all browsers , unless
otherwise noted”.

Given Shopify is “onboard” with Station could the Station team contact them to
relax their rather strict browser rules?

Mixmax isn’t working. This was my main reason for using Station — so I can use
Safari for nearly everything, and use Gmail with Mixmax without loading up

I’ve been using Station for a while without issue (beyond things like the
Copy-paste bugs etc).  
I updated my Surface Pro 4 to Windows 10 1709 last night, and then clicked on

are running, but the application seems to be invisible. Nothing on my taskbar.

I dont have this issue on my desktop (which is also running 1709).

I just installed Station on my Windows laptop. But after I clicked to open it,
it doesn’t show at all.  
I did see it running in task manager.  
Is there any possibilities to cause this problem?

Brief description of the issue

Station is not working properly after the 1.26 update. I can’t see the main
window, even though the menu appears in the mac toolbar and I can navigate the
menus. The “about” window appears if I open it from the Station menu. I tried
restarting the mac and also redownloading and reinstalling the app, but
nothing changed.

To confirm this, can you try to Quit Station, run this command in the MacOS
Terminal and restart.

    
    
    rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Station/window-state.json
    

It will delete the saved window position, and the window will reappear after
restarting.

Thanks for the quick reply [@Alexandre](/u/alexandre) .  
Since I am a curious developer, I opened that json file and found that it said
`{""width"":1440,...,""x"":-1440,...}`, so I set `""x"":0` and started Station. It
was correctly placed on my monitor again  
So I can assume that deleting the file would have fixed it.

I did it this way because I thought it could be helpful for you to know the
extra piece of information about the value that was incorrect (the `x`).  
If any of this infos can help, I can share the whole file. In addition, just
to add more infos, I usually work with an external monitor placed above the
primary monitor, and I use Station maximized on the primary monitor.

Hey everyone,

Yesterday I restarted my mac, and Station just stopped working. It is running
on the system, and I can see it in the tray, however the UI never draws, and I
cant see anything.

I have removed it, reinstalled it via brew, reinstalled it via the site,
nothing working.

Any ideas here?

Same issue. Running in Mac OS Mojave 10.14.

I’ve cleaned up all temp files for apps I’m currently using on Station,
restarted the system, not yet reinstalled, but all to no avail.

Eager for suggestions or resolution.

Update…

I use my Mac with two external monitors. When I last used Station (two days
ago) Station was displaying on one of the external monitors. When using the
laptop by itself today, Station launched, but as noted by
[@bleeisblee](/u/bleeisblee) , though the process is running, it would not
display on the screen.

After connecting to the external monitors, there it is, where I last left it.
There seems to be at least one related bug to this - Station ‘remembering’
last external monitor on which it was used, and not displaying for the
main/default laptop screen when not connected to the external monitors.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that …  
I start Station and a main application window does not appear. I can click
Window -> Bring all to front and nothing appears. View -> Process Manager
shows a bunch of processes running including one of Process Type Browser which
I think is the main thread. But I can’t see the main application. I can see
the About window. So it only seems to be the main application window that is
impacted.

This is on macOS. I have restarted Station without luck. I have also rebooted
macOS but still do not have a main app window.

   Trigger —

   Issue —  
The driver for quitting Station was that I had the Station Helper app running
crazy and consuming 400%+ of CPU according to Activity Monitor. I stopped the
app figuring it was some sort of runaway process. Now I no longer have a main
application window.

I wasn’t using multiple monitors but the trick of running  
`rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Station/window-state.json`  
worked for me. I’m back up and running now and will see if the high CPU state
kicks in that seemed to be somehow related to this triggering for me.

This morning I’m sitting down to start my day and I accepted the notification
asking me to upgrade to the latest Station. After I did, Station has
completely disappeared.

The application is clearly running. I’m getting notifications. But I’m not
able to bring Station to the foreground on my Mac so I can actually see it!

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that when I download the latest version of station 1.26.0, I
cannot open the app once it has installed. The program appears to install as
expected.

Once the application file is clicked, nothing appears to happen and the
program does not start.  
This happens when run normally and as administrator.

full screen. When not set full screen, there is no window or interface.

For Windows 10 I solved it this morning by following the logic of the thread:

  1. I closed Station

  2. I went to %USERPROFILE% folder -> AppData -> Roaming -> Station

  3. I then nuked the “window-state.json” file

  4. Run station, works as it should again!

So I guess bug now is: How to prevent from happening in the future.

Same issue. I stopped using station after it wouldn’t display anything in
MacOs. I tried reinstalling it, not succes,

Before that, it used to launch but only when I was at work???

Now it no longer launches at all. (appears in the launcher but no window)

I just open Station, and as you may know, the issue persists with version
1.30.0

As always, deleting `rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Station/window-
state.json` solve it.

P.S. I’m using macOS. For the next time (and if it appears again), do you need
my `window-state.json`?

[UPDATE 29 nov]  
The issue persists. Here are both files, the broken and working `windows-
state` ones

Brief description of the issue

The app won’t open. When I click on the icon in my dock it show’s Station on
the top left of my screen, but the actual app does not show up. Cannot find
the page anywhere even when I “show all windows”. Still get notifications
though, but they don’t open the app. It’s like it’s just invisible.

  

Mandatory details

   Trigger — Not sure, I closed it and then it started doing this.

   Issue — App went invisible basically.

I relaunched Station today (at work) and the window appeared.

I did the 1.31.0 update (from inside Station), restarted and still working.

I’m not sure if internal changes were made to keep this from happening in the
first place but things seems to be a lot better now. I was able to use the new
menu once and it worked. I haven’t seen the issue since. I do wonder if it had
something to do with plugging and unplugging into a dock so I would have
multiple displays active? I’ve used the dock for about a week and it hasn’t
reappeared.

Hello,

Since I last updated my Windows, I can’t open Station, as many of you relate.
I have tried to reinstall your last version, but it seems not to work.

What can I do?

Since the last update (like 3 days ago I think), my station is not showing
anymore I mean it is in the taskbar, I even get notifications but when I click
on it, nothing shows up (as if it was in another monitor but it isn’t) I tried
reinstalling and other things but nothing worked.

   OS version: Windows 10
   Station version:Can’t see it anymore

Update: I found a fix,

  1. Put your mouse over (do NOT click) the program in the Task Bar until the preview appears directly above it
  2. Right Click on the preview and select MOVE
  3. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to relocate to a part of the screen you can see (i used the mouse)
  4. Press the ENTER key on your keyboard when it is moved
  5. You can then use the mouse to move and resize the window as you see fit

hope this help anyone having the same trouble

PS to developers: it seems to be a problem where the program gets resized to 1
pixel (i think there should be something like “root.geometry(’{}x{}’.format(,
))” in your language

Hey [@Alanrey00](/u/alanrey00),

Thanks for reaching out!  
Have you recently disconnected an external monitor that you’ve been using?  
ìf yes, [this](https://community.getstation.com/t/station-window-is-
inaccessible-if-used-on-an-external-monitor-that-is-disconnected/3075) is
the problem you’re facing: the workaround for that issue is to reconnect an
external monitor and bring back Station to the main one.

If not, we’ll have to investigate a bit more

I found a solution. I am using Windows 10, version 1803. I did the following:

  1. Uninstall Station.
  2. Go to AppData folder. One way to access the folder is by typing ""%AppData% in the Run dialog box. This will lead you to the Roaming folder inside the AppData folder.  

  3. Delete Station folder inside the Roaming folder.
  4. Go to AppData>Local, then delete browserX folder.
  5. Reinstall Station.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that, since some update in December, I am not able to launch the
app. I have tried to download newer versions, I have reinstalled a couple of
times, open in admin mode… but it still doesn’t work.

It’s not like some post I’ve read about openning without loading content. In
my case, when I click on the shortcut/icon/etc it directly doesn’t make any
move at all. What can I do?

   Issue — It never opens, but it’s shown at the task manager like this (with only one click):

Same as many others here. This has impacted me only recently, sometime after
the 1.36 update. I now uninstalled and reinstalled the new download and it
says 1.37 in Windows 10’s list of installed apps, but same behavior, starting
the app does nothing and then there are just processes in the background.

It’s unfortunate. Basically the last 2 weeks have involved me not using this
at all, just hoping you guys update and fix it, but I’m just going back to
using a regular web browser. Hopefully I don’t forget to come back here, but
maybe one day when the app works? Not throwing shade or anything, like,
literally it doesn’t work. And honestly I love it when it does.

Same exact problem. Posted this in another (albeit MUCH older thread), but it
just never comes up. It worked for over a month on 1.35 and recently 1.36, but
about 2 weeks ago it just stopped working. I just tried uninstalling,
rebooting, and re-installing with the new 1.37 version I downloaded today, but
no different.

Clicking on the taskbar icon does nothing, but processes do start running and
look like they’re doing something:

Good news for me. Downloading the 1.38 version appears to have fixed this on
my end, at least for now. I uninstalled 1.37, reinstalled with 1.38. When I
first launched Station is showed up in a very minimal window similar to this:  

Fortunately I could at least see a window, and the underline in the taskbar in
Windows 10 showed it was running, unlike in prior cases:  

I could maximize and resize the window, and now it works. It preserved all my
apps, and now is actually something I can use. So that’s something to cheer
for!

I am attempting to use a Google Drive tab. I have added my account details
correctly, but when I try to access my drive a 404 is raised. The Drive tab is
trying to access the URL: <https://drive.google.com/drive/u/contact@gradba.se>

I am attaching a screenshot to help you investigate what could be going wrong.

This happened to me as well. Luckily, I managed to fix it! Here’s how:

  1. On the 404 page, the Google logo actually links back to the Google Search homepage! So click on that.
  2. In the Google Search page that comes up, search for “Google Drive”
  3. Go to the “My Drive” link in the search results
  4. Done! 

Hope that helps!

one chimed in.

Hi! I tried to configure both my Google Inbox and Calendar apps but after I

Keeps wanting to go to <https://inbox.google.com/u/>. Which generates a 404.
The correct URL seems to be (simply) <https://inbox.google.com/>

Perhaps this works if your email is @gmail.com but this is a custom domain
name (i.e. using Google For Business or whatever it’s called these days)

Easy fix?

Scroll your mouse to the top of your screen on the menu bar, click ‘View’ >
Developer > Toggle Page Developer Tools > Click on ‘Console’ Tab

Here you can execute commands, just like a command line except now you can
control your page.  
Yes that is correct. You can, just like your terminal or command prompt,
execute commands to go to specific urls within your browser.

For Calendar  
For G-Drive  
For ANYTHING  
It’s the same command with different urls, depending upon which url you’re
trying to go to.

> `this.document.location = 'https://www.calendar.google.com'`

and press enter

Now if you wanna go to Google Drive instead of Calendar, type in the regular
google drive/whatever service url you’re trying to get at.

It thinks the url it’s currently trying to go to ends with a /u/ or /r/ and
that’s what’s confusing it, so you give it a new url to go to and it will
permanently go there from now on.

You’re welcome

I just started getting this issue after we migrated to a new Google account.
Like everyone else, I now get 404 errors and the URL is appending my username.
(Which is incorrect for Google URLs)

The “fix” that others ( I’m looking at you, [Point-Of-
Destruction](https://community.getstation.com/u/Point-Of-Destruction) ) have
suggested, either navigating by clicking the Google logo or opening a
developer console, is a workaround and not an actual fix, as you will need
to do this on several applications every time Station loads.

persisted.

Hey guys, registered here since I got it working with an alteration of what
was suggested and I’d like to share it for the record.  
First go to any broken google service, for example calendar.  
open the dev console (ctrl-shift-i), go to console  
paste the following:

> this.document.location = ‘<https://www.calendar.google.com>’

confirm, it gave a new error message  
now paste

> this.document.location = ‘<https://calendar.google.com>’

it will NOT work if you go with the last one right away for some reason, but
doing the www first and remove it second worked for our company.

I had the same issue: Google apps work perfectly with my primary account, but
since a week or so it returns a 404 if I try to access it with a secondary
account. As I understand, this is because Station accesses the different
accounts using the URL https:/ /appname. google. com/u/example@gmail. com/.
These URL’s don’t seem to work anymore. The URL’s that use the structure
https:/ /appname. google. com/u/n/ do still work, where n is a positive
integer. I.e. the first Drive account you logged in with is accessible with
<https://drive.google.com/u/0/>, the second is accessible with https:// drive.
google. com/u/1/, and so forth. (don’t mind the spaces, the forum doesn’t
allow me to post more than 2 links…)  
So, as a workaround for secondary accounts, you can use the console tab in the
page developer tools to navigate to your secondary account like this:

> this.document.location = ‘<https://www.drive.google.com/u/1/>’

The same works for Calendar, Keep, etc. The only thing I can’t seem to figure
out is to change the default page when the app loads to that URL. Does anyone
know the command for that?

it was just continuously loading and giving me “reload” error messages, this

as of today and with the latest update this problem still persists…

If I recall correctly it once came up when I wasn’t able to log in to one of
my two google accounts anymore and it would always trigger the first one,
shortly after it worked again, the Google Drive App site kept showing the 404

I fixed the problem with a workaround today by completely uninstalling (incl.
deleting Application Support) and freshly reinstalling Station.

Its still not quite what I was hoping for. Currently you can switch into
Mixmax but you cannot use the standard extension WITHIN Gmail or Inbox. You
can tell the difference here, and it does affect workflow from signatures and

Here is the current update on Mixmax issues:

We identified 3 issues:

   issue #1: an email is marked as open in Mixmax tracking when you open it in your sent folder (reported by [@jb.ronssin](/u/jb.ronssin))
   issue #2: Mixmax is simply not loading in Google Inbox (and apparently sometimes in Gmail, tbc)
   issue #3: when accessing some Mixmax features (calendar), a blank popup appears

For issue #1 et #2, we identified the root-cause and a fix is under review
now. It should be available in the next release for middle of next week.

For issue #3, we identified the issue but we don’t have a fix for it yet. It’s
linked to a underlying Electron issue on which electron maintainers [are
working on](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/10221).

[@satori83](/u/satori83):

   just double checking: you are sure you enabled Mixmax in Station like described in the answer above?
   Otherwise, we think we still have a problem with Mixmax that is linked to caching, so that Mixmax can appear and disappear randomly. Could you send me a screenshot like instructed below?

Yes that’s a known issue (issue #3 i described above): we don’t have a fix for

Dear Station staff, after patiently waiting for you to even reply, leave alone
fixing this problem, I am uninstalling your software. This software is good
for people who don’t have plugins or extensions for gmail. Otherwise, I don’t
see how this could be what it was envisioned to be. For me atleast, this was
too good to be true. If anything changes, would love to hear from you and will
gladly reinstall. Good luck.

Since v.1.1.0,

I cant even get the baseline Mixmax features working now on my Desktop. After
messing with it for a while I could get it to at least work snd show on my
laptop, but no luck on Desktop. Looks like 404 resource errors I believe in

We’re still working on Mixmax, and more generally, on the support of Chrome
extensions. It’s going to take some time before implementation is fully
functional and bug-free.

It’s indeed one of our highest priorities but we can’t provide a reliable
timeframe yet.

Hi, I experienced another issue with MixMax being enabled in my Gmail. For
some reason it freezes my SalesForce. To the point where the Salesforce error
page comes up asking what caused the error. I know for a fact that it is due
to MixMax because in the Salesforce technical error it brings up MixMax
affecting the JavaScript in some way. Now it looks like it may even let me log
into Salesforce through Station. If it helps I’m using Salesforce lightning
and not the classic version

Hello everyone, big fan of Station and feel so relieved to find other MixMax
users who are experiencing the same challenge as me. I tried everything:
installing, reinstalling, signing out, signing in and felt alone. Even wrote
to MixMax support about this. I feel relieved that:

  1. I’m not alone
  2. This is listed as “working on it”
  3. That the capable and fast-growing Station team will support us and get this done in good time.

I hardly ever sign up for such forums, but (I love Station) and I’m glad to
see there’s others who have articulated the exact challenge and lastly that

I’m sorry for the lack of update on this. We are working on the support of

difficult to fix than we originally thought & we have a million other tings to
fix & build in the meantime. If we don’t give any update unfortunately it’s
because there is none so far. You’ll definitely be the first informed (on this

Hello there!

I would really like to sort out the Mixmax integration, because Station is
amazing and this would be a killer feature (at least, for me eheheh).

There’s another discussion (really old). And tbh cannot even figure out if the
problem is sorted for anyone.  
So this is my situation at the moment:

As you can see from the images in attachment, Mixmax is correctly installed.
The “standalone” Mixmax tab is correctly working.  
But not working at all in Gmail tab, the message showing when clicking on the
logo “You should click to enable” is unclickable and nothing shows up in the
composing window.

I already tried everything. Deactivate Gmail, Mixmax, both, one before the
other.  
Uninstalling and reinstalling Station. Long story short: every single
combination possible.

Can anyone help / givin’ feedback about his situation with this / sort this
out?

Thanks guys

Hey everyone,  
I’ve been using Station for a while now and I absolutely love it!

However, since this morning I’m unable to emails with my professional GSuite
account while connected to my Mixmax account

Whenever I click the “Send” or “Send Later” button nothing happens. I tried
relaunching Station, I even restarted my laptop in the meantime, but that
doesn’t fix it.

The only thing that fixes it is deactivating Mixmax.

Does anyone have the same problem, and is there a fix?

Hi Guys :),

So I’m using Gmail with MixMax, and everytime I want to send a message; it
stalls, first giving a notification that it’s ‘updating templates’ (I’m

email isn’t send.  
Only after refreshing the page, I can send the e-mail…

Hey [@thirty](/u/thirty), [@MikeDeeks](/u/mikedeeks) & [@rvdb](/u/rvdb)

I’m having a hard time reproducing this bug and gonna need your help

  1. Are you sure you enabled notifications in Station / disabled the [focus mode](https://faq.getstation.com/notifications-and-badges/how-can-i-disable-all-notifications-in-station)?
  2. Are you sure you enabled each app’s notification / didn’t [silence the individual apps](https://faq.getstation.com/notifications-and-badges/can-i-turn-off-notifications-for-a-single-app)?
  3. Are you sure you disabled [your OS’ “Do Not Disturb” mode](https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/03/10/how-to-enable-do-not-disturb-in-macos-and-silence-notifications)?
  4. Have you tested the behavior in your default browser: do you receive notifications there?
  5. Have you [updated your Station](https://faq.getstation.com/basic-functionalities-and-core-features/how-to-update-station) to the latest version?

The issue I’m facing is:  
2 x Goggle Inbox accounts, Google Drive, Google Keep, Google Calendar,
Facebook Messenger - none of these notify when messages arrive, they show the
wee red dot when I have Station open, but none of the usual Windows
notifications as one would expect or see in something similar like Wavebox

## The issue I’m facing is …  
One day last week, I cleared out my notifications and suddenly they stopped
showing up under the notifications tab and I know I’m being tagged on
different tasks and things like that. I’ve tried re-starting the app, turning
notifications off then back on, turning DND off then on and still nothing.
Please advise.

Just installed station for the first time.

By default, notifications were disabled (except for google) for all apps I
installed (that doesn’t seem like a good idea)

FIgured that out and enabled but still not get any notifications (other than
icon dot on gmail) no audio and nothing in the notification function other
than a martini glass. I’m using [outlook.com](http://outlook.com), office 365
(new layout) and gmail to do these tests…

I downgraded my office 365 view to the old layout and I get a notification
dot, but still no audio and nothing in notification center

I really want to stick with station and roll out in our company as we need to
be logged into 2 instances of microsoft teams at the same time but this is
critical

My problem is that … Hi,

Just started using station today - seems cool! I am not getting any
popups/notifications for any of my apps. Mightytext/whatsapp/skype,facebook
messenger, etc. I’m looking for a little red icon or something? Sorry if its a
dumb question but I can never see when any messages come in.

Okay, facebook messenger now shows a small red dot.

Skype, WhatsApp & MightyText still do not show small red dot. Can you assist?

I like I can turn them off when needed but they don’t ping up when turned on.

Seems like they’re just using code that worked in an old windows version and
haven’t fixed it yet.

I’ve just signed up for the forum because the little annoyances (no tray icon
anyone?) are really beginning to bug me.

How’s dev responsiveness? I see people have been reporting this since may here
& august in the other thread.

Might have to look into Rambox-OS, which is a shame because there’s a lot of
things I like better in Station.

Brief description of the issue

Hi

How can I enable popup notifications (similar to browser push notifications)
in Station?

I have notifications enabled, and I get the red dot on the bell and they
appear in the notifications list, however I’d like to be able to get a
popup/alert clearly visible even if I have Station minimized etc.

Maybe I’ve missed a settings somewhere, but I can’t find anything. All the
“notifications” settings I found are turned on.

Thanks!

[@maciekgrzybek](/u/maciekgrzybek) [@rvdb](/u/rvdb) Hi guys!! I’ve finally
found a work around to fix this issue! Here are the steps:

  1. Follow this guide to turn notifications on. [https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1075549?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en&oco=1](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1075549?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en&oco=1)
  2. Remove Gmail app from Station.
  3. Add Gmail app back to Station, again.
  4. Test sending email to your Gmail and you will get your first notification from Gmail!

This work around is based to the browser would ask the permission when we
enable the notification, so we should enable the notification first then add
it to Station to let it check the permission.

Love Station but Station loves me not. Or the damn Windows prevents Stations
from working cause it’s not the first app behaving this way.

   No notifications, not even a red dot in the Station window itself - gmail, messenger, whatsapp (see attachment)
   Focus mode disabled
   Station does not exist in Windows Settings - > System -> Notifications. It happens quite often. Shift is there, Mailspring is not there, Station is not there. No wonder I do not get notifications as Windows does not integrate with Station
   no Station among mail programs in Settings -> Apps -> Default. - Again Windows seems to ignore Station as mail app.

is useless without notifications

user-facing options as [@ChiaraMensa](/u/chiaramensa)

Interestingly opening up the devtools for page/station allows this code to
fire a notification from the JS console, suggesting its not an OS-side bug:

> new Notification(“Notification #0”, {body: “test”});

notification permission is always granted (even on non-TLS domains like
<http://neverssl.com> ) so the issue does appear to be internal to how station
generates or handles notifications.

I had the same issue with both Outlook and Gmail (station dock showed red dot
but not desktop notification).

Turns out you have to turn on desktop notifications within gmail and outlook
settings as Station relies on that to produce desktop notification and must
use a different system for the red dot.

Essentially, Station receives an error when I click on the notifications icon
in the Salesforce app. I’m guessing it’s something to do with how the
notifications feature works and Station doesn’t like it? For now it seems the

Pop up windows needed for Salesforce Functionality

As a user I want the ability to have pop up windows so that I can access
[Salesforce.com](http://Salesforce.com)’s full functionality.

GIVE US CONTEXT (tell us about the current experience)

When I am doing admin work in Salesforce it requires searching through account
records and linking cases/leads to accounts. In order to find the right one
salesforce presents a pop up dialog box.

PROVIDE DETAILS (tell us what you are looking to change)

I’d like pop-ups to be supported.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT (how would it change your experience)

The main advantages for me are: that I can continue to to use salesforce which
represents about 30% of my time but simply can’t without the popups. I would
use station as a homebase for many of my web apps if it had the functionality
and possibly bring my team on board as well.

The issue I’m facing is:

When searching for a particular user in the forecast tool, I am unable to
select the user from the popup window. Functions within each window work
without issue. For example, I can call the popup window to search user names
and within the search popup window call the list of users, but when I want to
select user to view back on the main window, nothing happens (In image below,
I am wanting to select the second user on the list, but I cannot view their
forecast after selecting on the popup window). Tried on Mac and PC.

Appreciate the merge, but to ask - any expected timeline to resolution?

Mind is a little blown that there are a couple dozen users who can’t use your
product due to a bug for two months (a top 15 issue by replies) and there’s
not even a reply from someone on the Station team…

Brief description of the issue

A few times now, if I leave Station running overnight, I come to the computer
(Windows 10) and find that the application doesn’t appear to be running
anymore. The window is gone, and although the app is pinned to the taskbar, it
appears as if it hasn’t been started.

Here we can see that Station is pinned to the taskbar and running (with the
underline), but in the morning I find the app there but no underline, as if
it’s not running:  

Sometimes starting Station seems to work, but occasionally it doesn’t, and I
had to reboot before it’d start working again. I also found that the CPU was
running hot, and trying to use Chrome or other browsers was extremely slow and
stuttering.

Today I found all these Station processes running the CPU in the background. I
killed them and restarted the app and it worked fine. This seems to be very
repeatable, but I’m not sure what the conditions are except for leaving
Station running in the background for long periods of time. I’ve never had
this problem in the middle of the day (in my memory, which isn’t perfect)… it
always seems to be after leaving it running overnight.

Hi,

The same at my laptop - boring / annoying / frustrating / #!%""/%!@&##>&@!!!

I wonder, if that’s in connection with the time Station was not active, the
time Station is running, the number of apps/pages that are open.  
Actually, in Chrome or Firefox this never happens.

I very much think of leaving it and open my work related web-apps in a normal
speedy browser. Though, the promise is great… The first post is 4 months old
now and a few new updates were released - and only 1 reaction from the staff
(as I can see).

I’m using  
Station - latest (as soon as I see there’s update)  
Win 10 - latest

Cheers,

Happens again. Leave Station running overnight, come to the computer in the

Station processes is burning:

Brief description of the issue

Ever since Station auto-upgraded to 1.36.0, when I come back to my laptop
after leaving it for anywhere longer than an hour or so (didn’t time it), I
often find it completely unresponsive in the app when I click. I hear the fan
spin up a bit, and then after about 10-15 seconds, it starts to respond to
clicks and works. This has happened to me at least half a dozen times in the
few days since I’ve been at the new version. It didn’t happen in this manner
in 1.35

That said, I’ve noticed newer topics getting merged with this one, so we may
be stuck in a bad loop.

Mods do you hear us?

Station performance is getting worse every time there is an update, it even
hangs now unceremoniously, never used to do that. There are times everything
freezes as well. Sometimes, it even refuses to open. When you try and download
files from gmail, they either hang, or freeze, or it shows downloading yet it
has downloaded. I am using Mac Book Pro on High Seirra version 10.13.6 with
Station version 1.41.1…It’s really a pain using this now, it is used to be
better…Thinking of quitting if the basics are not done right.

Wanted to add into this thread. I have had to drop Station from daily use.
Every update for the past month or so has made it more and more unstable.

Will probably check back in in a month or so, but at this point it is more of
a burden to my workflow than a benefit.

Station just froze as I was typing on Slack, so my case turns out has nothing
to do with inactivity. Maybe I can start a new thread with this info and
someone will actually pay attention.

SUMMARY  
Your need in one sentence

A workplace-ready version that doesn’t freeze often and randomly.

GIVE US CONTEXT  
Tell us about the current experience

When Station is open, whether or not it’s being used, it will often freeze
until Force Quit or at least a very long period of time (haven’t been able to
measure - but I have come back a few hours later and it’s responsive again).

For example, I often alt-tab to Station and it’s frozen. But it can also
happen while in use – it just froze when I was in the middle of typing a
sentence in Slack.

I’ve recently deleted all files (using CleanMyMac), reinstalled and am having
the same issues.

NOTE: This is NOT the same as [this

Hey everyone,

released within 3 weeks. It seems related to Google Drive, can you confirm
that?

Why is this going to take 3 weeks to fix?

I have the same issues as everyone else is reporting - seemingly random,
unresponsive switching which requires waiting at least 10 seconds for the app
to become responsive. (OSX Mojave, MBP)

This is a very frustrating issue that seems to have been unresolvable by the
Station team for over a year. The fact that users are persevering with this
bug is a testament to how much we  Station! Please get this fixed ASAP!

[@Georges](/u/georges) I can see why it may take 3 weeks, but I don’t see how
it has anything to do with Google Drive? I don’t have it in my Station.

There seems to be a misunderstanding about this thread over there, as this has
been going on forever, the thread status has been seemingly random, and now
this.

Please let us know if there’s any logs we can send, etc, to clarify the issue.
As I mentioned above, I’ve had it freeze as I was using it , so it’s
unrelated to inactivity, as the title suggests.

Me too!

Get a long hang almost every time mac wakes up from sleep, or I unlock from
overnight (does not sleep normally, just goes idle with screen saver).

I’ve looked at Activity Monitor, and one thread is definitely spinning - and
the app is taking > 2Gb of data, but, I have NO idea which task is hanging. If
I were to guess, I’d say Microsoft Outlook Pro.

I run 2-3 slacks, and outlook mostly. But, I also have telegram, hangouts, and
mightytext installed. I do NOT have Google Drive installed!!!

Let me know if I can provide any extra details - If this keeps up, I’ll have
to go back to rambox. Station is definitely prettier, but, rambox doesn’t have
the hangs.

Oh - one last datapoint. This morning, I went to the OS-X menus, and went to
Help / Bugs and Features Request. Station woke back up right after I clicked
the menu item, and the link opened on my open Chrome.

Thanks for chiming in. I just tried that function to unfreeze Station and it
didn’t work, but you’ve inspired me to look for new workarounds.

Rambox worked great for me, and the sync was nice, but damn is it uninspiring

Brief description of the issue

When I press the “start button” on Toggl (<https://toggl.com/app/timer>),

after a while (say, 12-24 hours), Station.app freezes (doesn’t respond to any
key or click) and even doesn’t quit on cmd+Q; I have to SIGKILL station to
quit.

Here’s a screenshot of [htop](https://github.com/hishamhm/htop) command while
the freezing:  

(I guess the process consuming many CPU% (202% here) and memory (2193MB here)
is more or less relevant to the problem)

I think it’s easy to reproduce for other than me, but if not, I’ll investigate
it in depth (please tell me what info is needed; I have an intermediate
knowledge of UNIX process and a bit about node.js and TypeScript).

We think we might have fixed this issue (or maybe part of it) in Station’s
latest version (1.42.1)  
Could you update your Station and tell us if it’s been solved for you?
We’re not perfectly sure as we still didn’t manage to reliably reproduce the
freeze.

If the problem is persistent, could you post here a screenshot of your process
manager:

  1. In the top bar menu: View > Open Process Manager
  2. Maximise the window to show all the columns ( especially the “WebContentsURL” one )
  3. Click on the %CPU column to sort it by descending order.
  4. Take a screenshot of your screen and post it here

To update your Station, just open the preferences (from the “Station” top bar
menu) and click the “Check for updates” button on the right.

I use Station daily on both a Mac and PC. Both run their latest respective OS
version (10.14.5, Windows 10 with all updates).

So far Station is now working better on my Mac. This screenshot is from my PC,
where the app has frozen or crashed twice in the last 10 minutes. On the PC
Station is unusable.

When the freezing occurs nothing about Station works except whichever app you
had active last. The menu bar lets you open menus and click things but nothing
occurs.

So it’s not possible to open the process manager.

Couple of days ago station stops allowing switching apps after some time
(happens 3 or 4 times a day) the currently open app works just fine, i just
can’t switch to other apps either by clicking on the sidebar or using the key
combos. What’s more irritating is that apps like Whatsapp and Telegram ask for
login everytime i restart Station.

CPU usage may be better …

but when will something be done about the runaway memory usage.

Just checked, it is sitting there in the background … 1.8 GB used???

Reopened station: 1.2 GB of RAM …

With three simple Gmail accounts. Nothing more. Only one account viewed at a
time. That seems a very excessive memory load.

Seems there’s at least do distinct issues being reported under this one
thread. 1. Apps within Station freeze/don’t load after inactivity and 2.
Station itself freezes. I believe the OP was for issue #1, which is what I
also am experiencing. I removed 1/3 of my apps hoping to reduce overall load,
but it did not help.

Here’s my screenshot of my processes. ToDoist won’t load at all right now.

Hello [@jeremy](/u/jeremy)

We’re still trying to reproduce this bug as neither [@Ronan](/u/ronan) nor
[@QuentinNetWash](/u/quentinnetwash) sent us their diagnosis files…

It would greatly help us if you could you send me - via private message - your
Station’s logs & db file.  
Just follow the steps described here: <http://faq.getstation.com/bugs-and-
glitches/how-can-i-report-a-bug-that-you-dont-talk-about-in-your-faq>

Cheers!

I have the same problem. I have 3 gmails logged in for google drive and for
gmail each, and when i switch there is almost always a problem.  
Lets say i have a@gmail, b@gmail, c@gmail. At times, when I click on a@gmail,
b@gmail or will show up, and vice-versa. other times, it just seems to favor
one particular account.

Even if i open a google doc from a link on a@gmail, it might open in b@gmail’s
google drive account.

I have tried switching “off” the accounts, but the problem still persists.

Hey everyone,

It seems like double clicking on the icon in the dock solves the
mismatched account problem. Can you try that [@TanviChadha](/u/tanvichadha),
[@MarkBrogowicz](/u/markbrogowicz) and tell us how it goes?

This latest update broke gmail.

Used to work fine. Now, it only shows inbox (not gmail) for a different
account than the one that is selected as ‘on’. I have removed and readded and
it does the same thing. (you can see in the screen shot that gmail is
selected, but inbox is showing)

And, since you @!##$% hide the account switcher, I can’t even switch it back!
btw, this is also super annoying when a drive file is opened with the wrong
account and I have to back to my browser to switch back. Give back the account
switcher or fix these errors!

Google calendar is broken too! I may have to stop using Station. Is there a
way to roll back to the last version? All was fine then. The ‘right’ account
is turned on, but it is showing content from another account, which is not

Seeing this in 1.21. When I upgrade to 1.20, I had to re-add all my services
since none of them showed up (had to re-auth too, but just clicking through
was enough).

Now in 1.21, everything is duplicated. Clicking on “Reset Current Application”
doesn’t seem to do anything besides reload the active page. Sometimes checking
the box makes one of the duplicates disappear, sometimes the toggles are
linked and it will enable/disable all duplicates, sometimes apps show up even
when all of them are off.

The issue I’m facing is that I accidentally started using Station with my work
Google account first and so any links that get opened externally use
authuser=0 when it should be authuser=1 (no way for Station to know this on
its own obviously). I need to know how to arrange the accounts to get them
using the correct user number. Some combination of removing/adding accounts I
presume, but what I’ve tried so far has not worked.

Brief description of the issue

I have two Google accounts in Station, one personal and one work. When I
receive Drive links in my personal account, if I click on them, they open in
the Google Drive tab for my work account. When I try to add contacts from my
work email, the Google Contacts page opens in the Google Contacts tab for my
home account. If I open a Drive document from the Drive home page for either
my work or personal account, the document opens in the correct tab.

(I don’t know if “tab” is the right word here – by “open in the X tab” I mean
“comes up in the list when you click the circular icon for X on the left-hand
side”)

It seems like for these links, Station is setting a default opening tab and
always opening in that tab. It would be great if Station could tell which
account a web app was being invoked from and open the account in that tab.

Note that the web app itself handles the account correctly – if I click on a
Drive link from my personal GMail, then although the window comes up in my
work Drive tab, I’m logged into that window as my personal account. So this is
just a UI issue, not a core functionality issue.

So it goes without saying that I’m also having this problem. I have 2 Google
accounts sharing Gmail and Calendar across 4 tabs (2 each); OAuth tokens for
each account are being stored successfully, and authentication isn’t a
problem, but yet the first account signed into is the one that gets brought up
for both Gmail tabs, and both Calendar tabs. As soon as I sign out of one to
bring up the other, it kills the session in both tabs, and suddenly everything
stops updating. It’s very clearly an issue of session/cookie/browser storage
data carrying over between tabs

The issue I’m facing is …

Evernote for web relies on the browser’s spellcheck to display misspelled
words underlined in red. Since Station is wrapping Evernote for web for use in
its desktop application, it needs to provide the same functionality. Right now
there is no indication of any kind when words are misspelled, and no way to
correct them with a right click and spelling suggestions. Without this
feature, I can’t use Evernote confidently with Station. Can we get this fixed?

## Thanks!

Hi, I’ve only been using station for about a week and I noticed there didn’t
seem to be a spell check function except in apps that have their own like
Gmail, But when I came here to request this feature I found topics like:

Station team: pretty pretty please fix this. I agree with Chris. This is
not even close to a feature request, this should be considered a bug. It is

Spell check broke here too after last Station update  
Steps to reproduce:  
a) write something in Whatsapp, Slack into the message field  
b) misspell one word, e.g. “caoutios” instead of “cautious”  
c) word is underlined with red dotted line correctly however if you right
click and try to select the correct suggestion in Station it won’t work. All
other items in the menu triggered by the right click work fine

Please fix!!! This was working before…

The issue I’m facing is:

## The grammar correction factor is going crazy. I have been doubting my own
spelling recently whenever I type words like “recommendation”, “differences”,
etc. Station’s grammar checker would always have a red line below those words,
thus compelling me to check my grammar or spelling. Please fix this!

️ Brief description of the issue  
Spellcheck is acting strangely.

My problem is that …

I have seen other old threads about this, but no fixes. So, I’m starting this
new one because I thing Station is awesome.

When composing an email in Gmail, the spell check is acting strangely, like if
the language was not switching, only English works.  
I write 50% French and 50% English at work. In Chrome or other wrapper (like
Firework) I don’t have to worry about switching the language as it switches
automatically.

I there a planned fixed for this?

So I know this is going to be incredible difficult to troubleshoot, but I’ve
noticed that Station will randomly add the strikethrough text formatting to
some cells in my spreadsheets. The sheet has to be open in Station but not in
the currently running application (for example: it’s active in Google Drive
but I’m currently in Gmail). I’m trying to nail down when it happens and if
it’s because of some combination of keystrokes but so far I’m unable to trace
it down.

Any help would be appreciated.

GMAIL does not have it as you are not running a GMAIL app. The spell checking

Add in an auto spell check feature that highlights or underlines mis-spelled
words like you see on Chrome, Microsoft Office, and other typing or email
programs. On a right click, or other action, you can correct the word with
suggestions that show in the menu.

This renders Station completely unusable for Gmail for me. It often just hangs
and when it’s back online, it will remain so only for a few seconds before
hanging again.

Even though this fix is more urgent, it should also be possible to turn the
feature off, support multiple languages at the same time like Chrome does (or
at least easily change between languages) and give context options on the menu
when right-clicking on a word (like alternative suggestions and the
possibility to add a word to the dictionary), as detailed on this feature

Really disappointed. I recommend Shift to everyone. I bet they’ll have hubspot

Again for everyone with this issue, go to shift, its free too and has
SPELLCHECK. lol.

I tried all apps like Rambox, franz all of them have the same problem though
these are great apps and you really enjoy using them.

It looks like it’s a bug with Chrome (Franz had the [same
issue](https://github.com/meetfranz/franz/issues/264)). Can you update your
version of Chrome or restart Chrome?

It works with version `Version 62.0.3202.94 (Official Build) (64-bit)`

Still having this problem, using the updated version of Chrome. It was working

This looks like a Google Chrome bug.  
Could you:

  1. Update Station to its latest version (v1.3.0) & restart it.
  2. Update Google Chrome to its latest version & restart it.

That should solve the issue. If it doesn’t, could you please post here:

   A screen recording of the issue
   The app name & the clicked URL

Hi all,

Reporting the same issue on the latest releases of Chrome and Station on
Windows 10.

<https://1drv.ms/v/s!AkHpT--GUQQ6hOEno0c047MDL0cU1A>

In this video, I reproduce this issue for Teamwork while showing it does not
apply to Twitter.

I’ve noticed this in Teamwork, Icloud, the Station Discourse app, and others.
When you attempt to open URL’s in a new window, or when a URL tries to do so
itself, nothing happens. Even if you right click and select ‘Open link in a
new page’, no result. No load, no white screen, just nothing.

This renders Icloud unusable, for example, as it forces the compose mail URL
to open in a new window. There is no workaround to compose in the same window,
AFAIK.

Loving station btw, hope you guys can figure out a smoother multi-window
experience across apps to make this more practical for power use.

Thank you for your hard work!

Sometimes, links opening outside of Station will trigger a blank Google Chrome
window and you won’t be able to access your content.

This a bug that is caused by Google Chrome itself that we can’t do much
about. The good part is that it’s really easy to fix: just restart Google
Chrome and re-open the link.

The bug will reappear from time to time: again, restarting Google Chrome
should do the job.

Right click on the link and ""open link in default browser"".

written to make a joke: “follow this complex procedure”, but really, when it
does not work, it’s not really funny

Eventually, after few days, figured out the issue in all 3 cases there were
LINGERING Station runaway processes, even EXIT from application did not remove
them, and as such it kept failing in these mysterious ways.

Solved all 3 cases, by exiting from app, using task/process monitor to kill
all Station processes (this is Windows7/windows10), launched again, and now
URLs open in default browser, and able to copy url with right-click  
Hopefully it helps, if not, sorry, that’s my experience, thought to share…

The root cause to many of these issues are just runaway processes… make sure
you close app, kill all lingering processes, and launch it again…

good luck.

Noticed Station updating recently, GREAT news… however, just wanted to report
the same CORE issues still persist on all 4+ PC’s windows 7/10 used, very
strange behavior and non-functioning of various things (copy/paste, open/copy
url) as described in this thread as well as : [Cannot click on URL and have it
open in browser](https://community.getstation.com/t/cannot-click-on-url-and-
have-it-open-in-browser/5198) thread.

The issues still exist in latest 1.52.2, despite reboots, reinstallation, etc.
nothing helps, after few hours of usage (with 4 apps opened, keep, whatsapp,
telegram and slack), the app starts to not function, exiting it, closes the
window, but leaves many Station.exe processes running, these MUST BE MANUALLY
removed/killed, if that is NOT done, then next invocation of the Station.exe
program still fails in yet other ways…

Raising the topic again, just to make sure others pay attention, if they have
these failures, test to see if EXIT from Station actually kills all processes
on the system (use task manager, process explorer, process hacker, etc. ).

Stormy.

This seems to be a huge problem for all of the ‘Station’ like utilities. I
have not found one that did not suffer from this bug… you can’t copy to your
clipboard, specially not from Gmail.

Some very rare times i have seen it working, why it mostly does not is a
mistery to me. I am sure i am not alone with this as i have seen the topic
been mentioned here and there… but there is never a solution and i wish that
there was, please let me know anyone if there is!

another smaller issue is that there is no option to ‘paste without format’ in
Gmail like there when you use Gmail in your browser tab.

The issue I’m facing is …

Copying to the clipboard isn’t working for me in the latest version of
Station. This is the case through all the apps I am using (Slack, Airtable,
LinkedIn, and even on this Station Community). I have tried it with the key
command and the dropdown menu, neither work.  
I am able to paste into Station, but only from things presently in the
clipboard (that is, things copied outside of Station).  
This stopped working upon updating to the latest version of Station. I have
not noticed this issue before (and I’m copying things to the clipboard
constantly, so I would probably notice).

  

Here’s the detailed report

working).

I’m also having the same issue and it makes Station almost unusable for me.

I noticed that the issue is with the initial click back to Station. So if I go
to another app and back to Station then the initial click back to Station
seems to only bring Station in focus but not the app you are currently working
in. So let’s say you copy something from Station and paste it in notepad. Then
you go back to Station and try to copy something again and paste it back into
Notepad, then it doesn’t work. Now if you would have clicked on Station twice
then it would have worked. So it’s like you have to click Station once to
bring it in focus and then click it again to bring the app in Station in
focus. I was able to replicate the issue and linked to a video below.

Here’s the detailed report

I’m still seeing this issue unfortunately.

Which is a real shame because Station is absolutely fantastic otherwise, I’d
happily pay for a paid version of this app if this bug was fixed.

It’s my only gripe with an otherwise near flawless system

For now I’m going to have to go back to tabs in Chrome, the lack of decent
copy-paste function slows me down more than Station speeds me up otherwise.

I have looked up the issue none of the fixes are working since monday.

Brief description of the issue

Currently I’m having a problem where I can’t right click on the image in
trello app for example and copy it. This is very handy when you need to copy
the image and paste it in github for example. This seems to be true for gmail,
slack, trello for me.

I’ve been having this issue for the couple of weeks after everything working
fine for a couple of months. Within that time I have grown very fond of using
Station so to see that this issue is still happening after a year of this
thread starting is disappointing.

I cannot copy out from Station using keyboard shortcuts, right-click context
menus on mouse or the Station drop down menus and I am using Windows 10.

Has anybody in the previous posts every found a solution over the last year?
Have any of the Station people said anything about this?

Thanks.

Brief description of the issue

Copy and paste don’t work in Station for me if I use a mouse. If I try to copy
using right click and the menu and then try to paste elsewhere (either within
Station or a different programme) there is nothing saved to my clipboard. I
also can’t use the right click mouse to paste within Station. I have to use
keyboard controls to do both. It’s been like this for months for me and it’s
relatively minor but a bit irritating.

The issue I’m facing is …

  

Here’s the detailed report

   Trigger: Password manager is not working.
   Issue: When I fill in all the information required to use 1password, it says everything’s good. But When I try to log in to other app by clicking bottom on the 1password message it begins to search the login and never finds anything. It’s kind of an infinite search.

I think the issue is that Station’s integration does not support two-factor
authentication. When I turned that off on my account, I was able to log in,
although once I turned two-factor back on I now get an error saying I have the
wrong master password (I do not).

I had the same issue with 1password in stations very persistently. After some
experimenting, it seemed to be an issue that I have spaces in my 1password
master password (as would be common when using a long phrase). I am guessing
that the integration some how isn’t passing the phrase with spaces correctly
to 1password. I am hoping that Station can fix this. While I could change my
1password, I’d really rather use a phrase which is going to mean most options
for me involve spaces.

I don’t have 2-factor on and it doesn’t work. I’m going to try JoelGratz’s
thought on the spaces. I have a long sentence (with spaces).

update: Just tried a password with no spaces and Station / 1password
integration worked.

I have mixed feelings about an unofficial 1Password service in general. While
it’s very convenient, the risk associated is scary. While Station is a great
app, I don’t have the same level of trust in their security infrastructure as
1Password’s.

I would highly recommend that people think twice before sharing their
domain/user/key/password on any external service.

David,  
In my testing it should work, it just doesn’t work if you have spaces in your

to do with the authentication integration on Station backend

Hello all. I use Station at work for Slack, Office, Salesforce, Datadog, and
it’s great!

Thanks for a great product!

One thing I noticed is that for Office/365/Outlook (eg MS apps), I have to
constantly reenter my password, even when I have checked remember password. Is
there anything that can be done about this on the Station side? I looked thru
options/prefs and didn’t see anything regarding this… just wondering if this
is normal and others experience this, eg is there anything that can be done to
alleviate constantly having to enter in the MS account password?

Also happens with Salesforce (actually the password dies quicker with this
app), and to a lesser degree with Datadog.

Thanks for any help!

We are currently looking to fix this issue but we are unable to reproduce the

I noticed there are mainly 2 related issues:

  1. you are being logged out randomly from Outlook after a certain amount of time
  2. you need to log back into Outlook after closing Station as the session expires

Does any of you still experience those issues?

Fyi: many of you are blocked on the “Signed out” page as Microsoft does not
offer a link to log back in & you do not know how to get back to the login
page on Station => you should right click anywhere on the page and chose
“reset app”.

Hi [@julien](/u/julien),

The issue does continue in the latest version of the app (details below).
While the first two items you mention do occur, the “Signed Out” page issue
can only be recovered by removing the app and adding it back. I’ve tried the
suggestion to double-click the icon. It doesn’t have an effect, at least on
macOS. I can’t speak to other platforms.

Let me know if there are any additional details I can provide.

Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM, OS X 10.13.6 and accessing mail through
<[outlook.office365.com](http://outlook.office365.com)>. Is there a setting
somewhere that allows a user to set the automatic logout duration after no
activity?

Hello there,

I have a quick fix for this annoying issue !

Solution :  
Just right click on the outlook window and press “reset current application”
(see pic).

Now you can re enter credentials !

Hello There!

I am also experiencing the required re-entering of password for Outlook Pro
every first time open when computer starts.

How could I enable auto-sign in and remove the need of re-entering the
password every time?

Cheers!

Hi,  
problem is still there in Station 1.31 (appimage on Kubuntu 18.04): using
Outlook Pro or Office 365 I have to log in every time I start Station.  
That doesn’t happen using Chrome (or Firefox or Opera if that matters).  
I’ve experienced the “being stuck on the Signed out page” too, but that’s not
deterministic; it happened, sometimes, it hasn’t in a while, and anyway now I
know how to escape the dungeon.

Bye

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that whenever I close my computer it seems to log me out or do
something. When I maximize Station from the dock bar on my MCBP it asks me to
re-login. It’s annoying, because, I use 2 outlook accounts and I need to sign
in over and over again even if my password is saved and the “remember me”
option is checked.

Team, I love Station, but what is merely a big inconvenience for some is an
absolute dealbreaker for many (myself included) on a Mac. I only use Safari
for performance/memory/energy consumption reasons, which doesn’t support
Google Meet at all. I’m totally dependent on Station for Google Meet, and I
can’t do any screen sharing with clients, etc.

Also, I want to bump [@AlvaroSantosAndres](/u/alvarosantosandres)’s
suggestion that a compilation flag may be turned off:
<https://github.com/avivace/deb-builds#chromium---hangouts>.

P.S.: I’m a full-stack JS/Electron engineer and would love to help fix this!
Also plenty of experience setting up toolchains and CI/CD for stuff like this.
Please get in touch and send me an NDA . Dead serious. Thanks for all the hard
work.

screen or on Slack for example it will say “Reconnecting…” and stay there
forever.

Is there a fix or a way to remove the updates and stick to the last version
that worked?

Brief description of the issue

I have 3 GMail accounts configured. Only one isn’t working. I click to open an
email, go to tag section, etc. but it stays “loading”.

I logout and login again but doesn’t work. I do a “reset current application”
but the same.

before the network is connected. Or, sometimes I loose WiFi connectivity and
the same thing happens. Once it errors, it will not reload. Even after killing
it and restarting. The only thing I can do to resolve it (short of deleting
the application and re-connecting it) is to load it in an extra window. Once
loaded there, it will load in the main Station window.

Hi [@windam82](/u/windam82) ,

I tried the sound on my station and with me Whatsapp works fine,  
you could try resetting the individual app or resetting Station all together
as a possible fix  
but i can’t guarantee that this is the best solution.

The first thing you can try is right clicking inside the tab with problems.  
You should get a menu that looks like this:  
  
In this menu click on “Reset Current Application”  
This could solve the problem.

Another way of solving this would be “Resetting” your station.  
But you will have to reconfigure your Station afterwards.  
You can find the guide on how to do this here:

below.

It won’t block me from using the app but really annoy to have such thing
around, I cannot even move it. Please help to fix it if possible, Station app
is really awesome and have been using for half of the year. Those improvement
will definitely keep users like me stay around for long.

I haven’t tried to remove and reinstall Station to see whether the dialog will
remain there or not, but I really don’t want to add all the services again.

Thanks in advance.

The issue I’m facing is:

Whenever I load Station I get a second, unmoveable and uncloseable window. I
attached a screenshot to it. I was really enjoying using Station and now this
is really a weird kink in the workflow.

So I opened it and now the app doesn’t load in that new window. I cannot close
it either because the “open, minimize, close” buttons don’t appear. And when I
minimize my main Station Window, I cannot find that “window” like other apps
do because it doesn’t seem to detect multiple windows open.

Thanks [@pleroy](/u/pleroy) for the report!

After restarting Station, does the issue occure again?

If so, could you please:

   focus on the grey window, open de Developer Tool (View > Developer > Open Station Developer Tool), and take a screenshot of the Developer Tool
   open the Process Manager (View > Open Process Manager), make sure to scroll right to display the column `Webcontents URL` and take a screenshot

My problem is that everytime I reset station or my computer, I must log in
again to Whatsapp, Telegram and Clickup,  
Moreover, Station can’t remember my password, and I’m using a different

That could have several reasons, what I believe is that it was not prioritized

I had the same problem of being logged out every time I exited my laptop.
Discovered that the problem was my setting for cookies in Chrome for ‘Keep
local data only until you quit your browser’ was off. The problem was
rectified when I set it to ON. More info at

- Cookies to switch it on.

I went to my already installed Google Chrome and changed it there. I don’t
know if station uses the installed Chrome or uses an own Chromium browser.

I haven’t heard about such verification within WhatsApp Web if you meant that.
But what you can try out is that you simply connect to WhatsApp in your
browser. If that works, it should work in Station as well, because it’s
basically the same.

To be clear - this is NOT the same issue as this one ([Swap Slack logo with
the workspace logo / Show team image instead of default Slack
icon](https://community.getstation.com/t/swap-slack-logo-with-slack-workspace-
logo/112)). This is definitely some sort of odd bug. Here is how it looks in
my Station right now:

After some wrestling with it, it is also incredibly sticky. I tried the
following and none of them fixed the issue:

   Removing the Station data folder (from Application Support on a Mac)
   Removing the Station app and reinstalling
   Doing both of the above
   Trying to mess with the caches under the development tools

None of those have worked, so there must be some other issue that is causing
it.

It is worth noting that I have a second user on the same machine (a MacBook
Pro) running Station with the same Slack teams, and the mini-icons display
just fine. So it’s something particular to a given Station instance. I’m not
sure what other data Station could be caching that could cause it though,
given the above troubleshooting.

Anecdotal possibility (possibly a red herring) : I know that I accidentally
mis-logged into one of my slack groups, and I think the bug manifested after
that. The mini-icon showed up for the first Slack group I added that, but
never has since then - including for the original slack group, after I removed
it and re-added it during the troubleshooting.

That’s the info I have. Hopefully helpful in debugging.

So this is how far I have come on troubleshooting this issue.

If I open station through my phone’s hotspot, bypassing the corporate proxy, I
can log in.  
I then switch back to the corporate network with proxy and station works
perfectly fine as expected after the auth has occured.

It seems as if the authorization request from Station fails to retrieve a
token. The error message on screen indicates the same.

If I auth my google account through Chrome web browser through the corp proxy,
it works.

I tried resetting Station as suggested but made no difference.

Hi Georges,  
not sure if multiple people requesting a feature make it more of a priority,
but if so I’d like to add a “me too” to this issue. I’ve tried Station at home
and think it’s a great system, and was going to recommend it at work where it
be ideal for many of users. However, like a lot of corporate environments we
have a proxy server, so it’s a non-starter. To be honest, since it seems like
Station is squarely aimed at the corporate user, I’m surprised you’ve made the
decision that this support is a low priority

SUMMARY  
Your need in one sentence

As a user behind a proxy I want to log on the proxy once so that I don’t have
to log once for each application I use.

GIVE US CONTEXT  
Tell us about the current experience

When I connect to the VPN, I have to enter my credentials for the proxy 9
times, one for each application i need to use, that’s the main reason I’m not
adding more applications.

PROVIDE DETAILS  
Tell us what you are looking to change

I’d like to log in once, or have the possibility of configuring the proxy
credentials for station to use instead of asking for manual login.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT  
How would it change your experience

The main advantages for me are:

   Not writing my user/pass 9 times or more each time I reconnect to the VPN (multiple projects equal multiple VPNs)
   Improve my experience with station and start adding more apps to increase my productivity, as right now, i would rather use Chrome or Firefox because both allow a single proxy login instead of multiple logins.

[@kev160967](/u/kev160967) can you please provide your configuration details:
OS version and Station version.

There is no proxy settings in the app itself because Station detects system’s
proxy settings. That’s the same strategy used by Google Chrome and the same
detection mechanism.

That could mean your proxy’s settings are not properly detected. Before all:

   can you check your system proxy settings are properly configured
   can you access the internet with Google Chrome? In Chrome, can you take a screenshot of the content at `chrome://net-internals/#proxy` (if it contains sensitive information, send me privately or hide sensitive information)

Hi you all,  
as far as I read Station now works behind a proxy.

But, I’m trying this new feature and it does not work in my office. When I try
to login using the button “Login with yout work account” then new window
remains in white forever.

I have checked that the proxy is set in system configuration and it is because
I can navigate using Chrome.

The only thing I was wondering that can cause trouble is that the proxy is an
authenticated proxy. When I run Chrome browser a pop up is shown to fill user
and password, but when I execute Station no popup is shown, so maybe that’s
the problem.

Sorry, but I don’t know where to get the logs to share with you.

Thanks in advance.

Hi [@lucacin](/u/lucacin)

Our proxy is authenticated as well, so it should work.

Can you retry these steps but bypassing the proxy? Essentially what you want
to do is keep everything exactly as is when trying to connect but bypass the
proxy with a phone hotspot or similar. This way you’ll be able to identify if
the problem is not something other than the proxy.

If it succeeds without proxy using the exact same Laptop/Desktop then you
might need to dig a little deeper with the proxy admins.

The issue that I’m facing is that when i click on a link of bitbucket in slack
i get forwarded to an tab on chrome even though i have bitbucket app already

I’m not sure whether this is a feature or a bug but i hope it get’s fixed

I’ve found this to be more sporadic. Sometimes when I’m emailed a link to a
doc it’s opened in Station and other times it opens in my default browser. One
recent case I noticed where Station didn’t “catch” the link properly was when
someone used the Google URL shortener on the google doc link. I imagine it
would be hard for Station to get this right 100% of the time so maybe you
could add it to the right-click menu.

When I click a link and it doesn’t behave the way I want to, I can right-click
and force it to open in Station (or force it to open in my default browser).

The issue I’m facing is:  
In Station, I click a gdocs attachment in Inbox or a gdocs link in Slack and
the gdoc opens a separate tab under Slack or Inbox. I expect it to open in
Chrome by default because keeping track of my Gdocs tabs, which are nested
under other Station app is very difficult. Interestingly, it does this despite
not having Google Docs enabled as a Station app.

Is there any way to have links and google docs open in my default browser from
Station?

Loving Station, but I’ve noticed an issue with Gmail and Bitbucket. If I open

 SUMMARY  
When I click a link in Slack to Asana, Help Scout, Drive, etc, open it in that
app, within Station, instead of a new tab in the default browser, outside of
Station.

GIVE US CONTEXT (tell us about the current experience)

When I … click a link in Slack (is the most common source, but there are
others) to another one of my Station apps, open it in that app (not in
Slack/the source app), within Station.

PROVIDE DETAILS (tell us what you are looking to change)

It’s similar to this request: [Open external links in Station instead of other
browser / set Station as the default browser (instead of Safari, Chrome,
etc.)](https://community.getstation.com/t/open-external-links-in-station-
instead-of-other-browser-set-station-as-the-default-browser-instead-of-safari-
chrome-etc/2296) but I DON’T want stuff that is not one of my apps, to open in
Station. That stuff should load in the default browser. Unfortunately that
is inconsitent as well. Links in like those I’ve mentioned, open in the
default browser. But links in Facebook Messenger (for example) to Facebook,
open within the Messenger App. I don’t have the Facebook app (if there is
one), so I’d like those links to open in my default browser, outside of
Station.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT

The main advantages for me are:

   It’s quicker, easier, and more intuitive. I’ve got all these apps, why push links between them outside of Station?

There’s a few issues with the Atlassian app:

   In a jira case you can click on a link to navigate to bitbucket (such as a commit, branch, or pull request). The link does not open in the bitbucket app, but opens in the Atlassian app instead.
   This also changes your home to bitbucket for the Atlassian app and it takes a few interactions to get back to Jira.

  

Here’s the detailed report

still experiencing this issue.

Its frustrating and difficult to get the jira(atlassian) app to go back to
jira once the home is on bitbucket. Bitbucket has its own app, but jira links
to bitbucket do not go to the bitbucket app.Workaround is usually to uninstall
the Jira (atlassian) app and reinstall it.

Could we get a button to set the Home? or be able to lock it so that it does
not change.

Hey [@JasonAnsley](/u/jasonansley),

Since i’ve managed to reproduce that bug it’s going to be added to our bug-
fixing roadmap: thanks for the detailed report!

In the meantime there’s an easy workaround. If the print pop-up doesn’t
appear:

  1. Go back to your main gmail page
  2. Revert to the “print email” page
  3. The popup should appear within seconds.

SUMMARY  
I need to be able to print the page I’m looking at.

As a user (specifically Medium app) I want to press Ctrl+P or select File ->
Print so that the page I’m looking at is sent to print preview using the
correct media CSS (if exists), and from there I could print it out physically.

GIVE US CONTEXT  
Tell us about the current experience

When I read a post, I’d like to send it or save it as PDF, or just print it
for further reference. Today, in order to do so, I have to copy the current
page URL and paste it into Chrome, eventually authenticate there (as I’m heavy
Station user), and then I can print. I believe printing is a necessary feature
to be added.

PROVIDE DETAILS  
Tell us what you are looking to change

I’d like printing to be implemented as it’s in Chrome.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT  
How would it change your experience

The main advantages for me are:

   I won’t have to do page URLs juggling between Chrome and Station
   This will keep me more in Station. Usually, if I depart Station and go to Chrome, then why return?

Hi,

I’ve long been having the same problem: PDFs printed from Gmail being full of
blank pages, barring the first page.

Or at least I used to – since the most recent update, the Print dialogue does
not appear at all when I click on the Print Message or Print All links in
Gmail. Never used to have a problem with that before.

Both issues are the same as described above.

I would like to see a print preview option added to Station that is similar to
how the print preview works when using web apps in Chrome. This would make it
easier to adjust print settings and see what the results will be, without
having to save as a PDF each time first. Specifically, this is in reference to
printing views in AirTable.

Hi,  
the same is happening here. Sometimes the gmelius buttons appear (on composer
window), sometimes not.

Already uninstall both Gmail account and gmelius, but the problem persists.

I’m experiencing exactly the same issue. I thought that all my emails sent
through GMail Station were tracked, but they haven’t. Mailtracker doesn’t work
neither. I’m devastated.

For me tracking emails is a must. Can you please recommend me a GMail
extension that does it and works with Station? Thank you!

Ever since a recent update to Gmail and GetStation, gmelius doesn’t render or
load properly in my gmail inbox. This means tracking emails and other features
which I rely on aren’t being used.

This is pretty mission critical for me, will most likely get off station if I
can’t track my emails or manage them properly with gmelius. Would definitely
appreciate an update on this!

The issue I’m facing is:

Gmelius thinks I’m the recipient. Whenever I open an email in Gmail, I get a
notification that the recipient has just read the email. It seems to be
misidentifying the Station client.

I wish I could use Gmail in Station but this is the one thing holding me back.

Hey

I have 3 Gmail accounts also setup as different apps on Station. I am using
the Gmelius addon for each of them, however for some reason it keeps getting
removed and won’t re-enable. I try disable/enable it and refresh the page, but
it still doesn’t show.

Sometimes it will re-appear and ask me to reconnect gmelius a few days later,
then disappear again later on.

Any ideas why?

Thanks.

Brief description of the issue

I’m seeing the little red notification dot on all slack channels even when
nothing is updated. Is there a way to change this behaviour? For example on
messenger, it’s just a faded logo, and when a new message comes in the red dot
will appear (which I guess is how it should function).

I also face this issue but when I can’t exactly narrow down when and why it
happens because it doesn’t always occur. When I restart station then slack
goes back to behaving correctly. FWIW whenever the unread count doesn’t change
the slack keyboard shortcuts also stop working.

We are working on fixing the issue, and it should be released next week.

notifications from “Interruptive alerts” to “Browser notifications”. We are
explaining a similar manoeuvre

There may be better ways to solve this problem, but for now i found these two
options.

The first thing you can try is right clicking inside the current app that has
problems.  
You should get a menu that looks like this:  
  
In this menu click on “Reset Current Application”  
This could solve the problem.

Another way of solving this would be “Resetting” your station.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that …  
After updating to 1.26.0 I am noticing that Gmail will not allow me to delete
emails. I have not found a workaround for this other than using the browser
version or app on my phone.

Also, my Google Calendar does not recognize that the new day has begun and
seems to be frozen on the previous day. I have to close Station and restart it
for it to be usable.

Brief description of the issue

My google calendar keeps getting hung. It happens very frequently now. At
least 3 - 4 times a day. I just cannot do anything on it, including refreshing
or reloading by ctrl+r or double click on icon. I have to uninstall the app
and install again to get it to work. This has been frustrating since I’m now
having to use google calendar on the browser while my email is on Station.

We are working on fixing the issue, and it should be released tomorrow.

In the meantime, there is a small workaround: in Calendar settings, change
notifications from “Interruptive alerts” to “Browser notifications”. We are
explaining a similar manoeuvre

Last working version was 1.25.

1.26 and 1.27 will “load” forever. When it finally does, it won’t let me
delete emails, check slack or any other app.

Is there a way to prevent an auto-update?

It’s so frustrating since everytime it auto updates, I have to do a clean
uninstall and then setup 1.25 all over again (By the 4th time you begin to
lose hope…)

[@DevBytes](/u/devbytes): the problem persists on with 1.28.1 on windows 7 pro
64 bits (which is not really an uncommon OS version): everything is slow and
some the applications even fail to load (like gmail which would just not
succeed to connect with an error message). This is true even after clicking on
“Reset Current Application” for every app.

And I discovered that even after deleting `%APPDATA%\Station` (to have a
vanilla installation), station 1.28.1 is really slow even to just display it’s
first login page (where you put your email address to be able to use station).
So there’s really something wrong beginning with 1.26.0 (which, as a reminder,
is a version that uses [a new version of electron which was upgraded to
3.0](https://github.com/getstation/desktop-app-releases/releases/tag/1.26.0)).

As a simple summary:

   station 1.25.1 (electron 2.0.2) on windows 7 pro 64 bits: everything smooth
   station 1.26.0 and later (electron 3.0) on windows 7 pro 64 bits: everything is slow, there are timeouts in apps (like gmail), most apps simply never load. Even with a vanilla profile (= remove`%APPDATA%\Station`), station is really slow (more than 10 seconds) to load the first login form.

It would be great if you could test it on your side on windows 7 because
that’s where a doubt remains (as you explained, it works fine on windows 10).

Or is there someone else that could/should do the test (no offense
[@DevBytes](/u/devbytes) but it is in fact not clear whether you work for
station or not by looking at you station community’s profile ). Maybe
[@Alexandre](/u/alexandre) is the right person to ask?

In the meantime I reinstall 1.25.1 everytime I close station or reboot my
computer to be able to work. I don’t mind doing it because station is a good
piece of software that helps me being organized in my everyday work. But I
certainly hope that this problem will be properly tested on windows 7 on your
side.

Hey [@maximd](/u/maximd),

This bug has been fixed since Station 1.27 release… except on Windows 7
apparently where you and other users (hey [@Rosebudd](/u/rosebudd) ) have
reported persisting issues.

Unfortunately, we don’t plan to:

   Give the option to block auto-updates → Having a homogenous user-base with an up-to-date Station is a huge asset (facilitates support, onboarding, communication & testing)
   Add Windows 7 to our Quality Assurance process → Windows 7 is an obsolete OS that’s nearly 10 years old, and whose support will soon be discontinued by Microsoft.

Have you considered updating your OS?  
We understand it can be a hassle but there’s not much we can do for the moment
as we prioritise improvements that affect a higher % of our user-base.

[@Georges](/u/georges) Ok, at least we know what the official position is
regarding windows 7 (and this position makes sense).

Switching to windows 10 is planned but as we are a company using commercial
software which are not 100% stable yet on windows 10, the testing and
deployment will still take some time. So, for now, we will keep using 1.25.1
as long as it works.

Experiencing the same issue on Windows 10

It’s been happening for close to a month, and I know I’ve had at least a
couple updates to Station, but here are my current details:

Station version 1.17.1  
Electron 2.0.2  
Chrome 61.0.3163.100  
Node 8.9.3  
v8 6.1.534.41  
@getstation/services 0.19.2

Most recent occurrence was tonight when I clicked on the Paper app, which I
hadn’t used since I last “freshly opened” Station yesterday. As soon as I
clicked Paper, a pop-up window appeared, which briefly showed a title of
“collection-chooser” before changing the title to “Dropbox”. When I first saw
this behavior I had both the Dropbox app and the Paper app, but I removed the
Dropbox app, since I really only use Explorer to interact with Dropbox and I
was hoping it would change this behavior, but the same behavior was exhibited.
My current work around is to minimize the window for the collection chooser
and ignore it.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that whenever I open up dropbox paper and go into a document,
the following popup (image linked below) comes up. Whenever I try to close it,
it just reappears. It only closes when I exit any document. Not sure what the
problem is.

I have noticed a difference in behavior recently (sorry, but I can’t remember
exactly when; probably at least a month ago). Now I notice that the pop-up
doesn’t show up for me until I open a document (it used to be on loading the
Paper app). As before, I can’t make the window disappear, but I can put it in
the background. After I close the document and am back at the Paper dashboard,
I can close the pop-up window and it will stay shut. While not ideal, I
consider this an improvement over the original issue where I had to restart
Station (with a different app active) to get rid of the extra window.

Hi [@Georges](/u/georges),

I think I figured out why it happens.

When downloading an attachment, Slack opens a new tab, so if I hover on the
Slack icon in station, I see the previous “Download tabs” (also, it shows a
white screen when downloading an attachment, it is that new tab).

If I close these tabs, next restart is fine.

So I guess it is because station reloads all these tabs at relaunch.

Edit: A bit too late, 'cause I see it actually works nicely on the current
version

Downloading issues

Hey people, i’m facing an issue on Station. I don’t know if it come directly
from it, but, at every launch/restart, Station is downloading all the files
created/saved in google drive to my folder download on my pc.

So you can imagine that after two weeks of work on, i got like 500 files
downloaded automaticly. This is boring, and it reduce the launching speed of
my extensions…

So after research, i was focus on “Google Drive”, but there is nothing to do…
I think there is something i missed between Station and Google Drive.

Thx for help, you are a “Rock-Star” !

Brief description of the issue

Gmail attachment redownloads itself at every Station startup

  

Mandatory details

   Trigger — Gmail Attachment Download . . . Regular Station startup

   Issue — I’ve had a problem where, after downloading a Gmail attachment one day,  
then going about my day and closing Station… Whenever I open Station again, it
automatically redownloads the same file (over and over), even though I’m at
Gmail home (and not closing Station on that email). I don’t know what to make
of it, but after the 10th time, I decided to report.

   Explanatory gifs/pictures — 

   OS version — Windows 10 64bit

   Station version — Latest as of today - 1.37.2

Sorry about the duplicate post, thanks moderator for moving and closing mine.
Had searched for it with other words, tried some searches with no luck so, in
a hurry, created my own topic.

Everytime I open Station a couple files get added to my Downloads. - again,
and again, and again. I think you get ti - like - EVERY TIME I open Station.

I’m using the latest version of the app on the latest version of Mac OSX.

I’ve stopped using Station because of it. Any ideas?

Hey, I think I solved this for gmail attachments! This problem was plaguing me
too with gmail. MacOS High Sierra. The same two attachments from last month
were downloading every time I opened the app.  
When I hovered over the gmail logo on the left bar (where all the apps are
located), there popped up a list of about a dozen emails, and when I x-ed them
off the list, the downloading stopped, because sure enough those two emails
were among that list. Not sure what that list is, it’s kind of like open tabs
maybe?

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that …  
whenever I turn on station (or switch to gmail) there’s a certain mail
attachment that keeps re-downloading over and over again with every
restart/switch, even though I already downloaded it dozens of times.  
Is this a known issue? what’s the workaround?

There is a definitely an issue on the Station platform. Same keeps happening
to me as well,. I am on version 1.40.1 - it just keep re-downloading the same
file over and over again. It’s really annoying…

Also, you have a bug which says the file is still downloading and yet the file
has been successfully downloaded.

Please rectify.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that GMail downloads files nearly every time I access the app.
This occurs ever since I open the app in Station, and it drives me crazy. The
files are files that I once wanted to download; they then downloaded
successfully, but now they’re being re-downloaded, which is not what I want.

I have the latest version of station and it automatically downloads the last

be a resolution for this or any updates from the dev team. For now I’ve put up

Hi, same issue here.

   Which app triggers the download? Gmail

   What type of file is downloaded? PDF

   Most importantly, what is the link that triggers the download? It automatically downloads a certain file every time that Station is launched. That file is not the last one downloaded by me, it is just the same file every time.

   Trigger — Relaunching Station

   Issue — Files are downloaded when I’ve not asked for files to download. I did download them in the past but I am no longer sending the request for this.

   Windows version — Windows 10 Pro

Hey [@Georges](/u/georges)

The issue is on all version of Station even with the latest one 1.49  
It happens with files dowloaded from either Slack, Gmail accounts or Drive as
far as I am concerned.

My current workaround is to clear cache but I have to re-log every account
every time I do it.

It then works fine for a couple of app launch but at some point it starts
again and always with a few specific files that wil re-download on every
launch but not the others i’ve dowloaded throughout the day

say opening SSO, and then I get the google account window and enter in my work
email and I can’t get in.

Hey thanks for your report. I think this will be difficult to reproduce for
the developers, but it definitely looks like a bug on the Station side.

Just to be sure, please try this:  
Can you login in the same way in the latest Chrome browser? Does this work
without problems?  
Can you login into your Google account without the use of OneLogin / just with
your normal credentials?

Please let the dev team know what works.

Hope this helps

Do you mean log into my Google account in the latest Chrome browser? That

Ok got it so it’s a Google Apps account with Single Sign On it seems. I don’t
know the details of SSO but maybe the station team can look into this.

I can’t reproduce this cause I don’t have OneLogin but maybe I can setup SSO.

I was having trouble with getting workday to load inside station because we
use Okta for login. You can’t login to workday from workday if you use okta
but clicking the workday link in the okta app opens a browser tab instead. To
get around this I opened Okta in Chrome and then copied the link address for
the workday sign in from the okta launch page. Then in station, open the page
developer tools (View > Developer > Toggle Page Developer Tools) and then
under the javascript console I ran `window.location = ""[Workday link copied
from Okta]"";` and that signed me in no problem since I was already logged into
okta inside Station.

Hopefully someone else finds that helpful.

I am having exactly the same problem. My workplace uses Duo as 2-factor
authentication for G Suite, and now I cannot log into Station on a new

 SOLUTION for ONELOGIN users: log in w/personal gmail, then add slack work
acct and onelogin should let you get in that way -  click remember
browser and then when you add work acct as secondary gmail, it will let you

We are in the process of implementing the new version of Electron (the open-

Same issue. The page just keeps trying to load. After Application Reset via
Station Help, sometimes reset has to be done 2-3 times in a row before Asana
will temporarily work again. Also, yellow/dark orange bar across top of Asana
is often displayed indicating it cannot connect and is retrying…but it never
resolves without application reset.

So Asana worked all day yesterday for me. My computer (I think) went to sleep,

I have confirmed this has nothing to do with logging out/in or computer
sleeping/locking nor the dasboard icon for Asana being relocated
(automatically or manually) within Station.

I have had the white screen of death 4 times in the last 10 minutes after
application reset. It seems that I can comment or other perform an Asana

This tends to happen for me when I have moved away from Station for a while or

it’s gone to sleep without a hard reset. When I first launch Station, Asana is
usually working fine.

I’ve experienced the same issue with Asana in Station for months. Even on the
latest build (1.49.0) I have not seen any improvements in behavior.

Like others have mentioned, from time to time Asana just stops loading any new
content. Clicking on a project just continues to load forever with the
skeletal loading animations spinning until I manually reload the app.

There does not appear to be a specific trigger. Most often I notice when going
back to Station after a few minutes of using another app. However, it also
happens just randomly if I’m actively using Asana in Station as well.

I love Station and want to continue using it, but the connection issues are
becoming unbearable. Asana is by far the worst (although Gmail also seems to
lose connection quite often).

I loose my Asana connection at least 4-5 times a day. Each time I have to
refresh the app (Cmd+r). This has been occurring regularly for months (perhaps
a year or more). Very frustrating.

I’m at the point where I may ditch Station for Asana and just leave Asana
pinned in my browser. But once I go that route, why not just go back to
pinning all my apps in the browser like I was before Station?

Hey [@andreyu](/u/andreyu), [@BryanGrandy](/u/bryangrandy) &
[@Alanrey00](/u/alanrey00),

I’m having a hard time reproducing this bug and gonna need your help

  1. Are you sure you enabled notifications in Station / disabled the [focus mode](https://faq.getstation.com/notifications-and-badges/how-can-i-disable-all-notifications-in-station)?
  2. Are you sure you enabled Gmail notifications in Station / didn’t [silence the individual app](https://faq.getstation.com/notifications-and-badges/can-i-turn-off-notifications-for-a-single-app)?
  3. Are you sure you disabled [your OS’ “Do Not Disturb” mode](https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/03/10/how-to-enable-do-not-disturb-in-macos-and-silence-notifications)?
  4. Have you tested the behavior in your default browser: do you receive notifications there?
  5. What version of Station are you using and on which OS are you?

I have the same issue. Unfortunately it’s making Station very hard to use. I
do not currently get any notifications within the App or an app badge icon in
the doc. --I’m using the latest Mac OS.

I’ve had this issue as well and I believe it’s an issue with gmail’s newest
update and not with station. To fix it try the following:

  1. Click on the cog icon in the top right, choose settings.
  2. In the general tab scroll down a bit, be looking for a “Desktop Notifications” section. On mine when I updated it turned this off by default, selecting “New mail notifications on” fixed this issue.
  3. Try sending yourself an email from another account.

Hopefully that works for you!

Brief description of the issue

I am noticing very inconsistent experiences around notifications across
different apps within station. Some things I have noticed:

   seems like if an app window is currently open, the notification alert (Mac alert) does not show and the notification does not appear in stations notification panel - but the app does get a red dot (this is happening very consistently with GMail for me
   if notifications come in close together I only get one - if i get a whatsapp message ill get an alert, if i get another message within a minute or so (after the previous notification has disappeared), i do not get a new notification
   certain apps are not showing notification dots - apps like whatsapp and android messages do not seem to show red dots even though they show a notification in the panel and i get a pop up

When I am in Slack and hit Cmd-T (muscle memory), the Station search/chooser

Slack’s. But when I hit Esc or Cmd-T again to close Station search, Slack
hasn’t regained keyboard focus and thus I can’t type within Slack nor use

Im also having issues with slack keyboard shortcuts not working, but also not
marking chats as read when swithcing channels. It should mark the channel as
read when the chat gains focus, but something is causing it not to focus

working.

When I open the developer tools the page, I can see window events that show
the window has gained focus, then it tries to clear the unread chats but stops

It seem to be related to number of characters that has been entered into the
chat window.  
Switching into Skype to write something small like a smilie works and then
back out.

If you write a long text message and then switch to Skype, paste it, send it
and then switch to another application, it will not crash. Tiresome but works
as a semi workaround.

Start to write a longer text message, and it crashes more or less at the same
amount of characters. You can still write with the “crash” box appearing and
once you hit ENTER the message is sent. You don’t see what’s being written but
its working in the background. When you then hit reload, the message you wrote
will be seen and showed as sent.

Looks like the website is broken now. Some analytics script isn’t working, and
now I can’t add any apps. Clicking on the + button opens the apps site, but
it never loads. You can see the error in the console when you open the

Hey there

I’m having a hard time reproducing this bug.  
Could you help me identify reproduction steps and triggers :

   When you are mentioning “+” button, you mean the “+” button next to Whatsapp? Does it work with other applications?
   When you’re facing the issue could you “[Toggle Page Developers Tools](https://cl.ly/saVu)” and send a screenshot of your console?
   Are you sure you are connected to the internet when you are installing the app?  
This should help us fix this nasty bug!

   When you are mentioning “+” button, you mean the “+” button next to Whatsapp? Does it work with other applications?

Yes, all apps are broken, only apps already added to Station are working

   When you’re facing the issue could you “[Toggle Page Developers Tools](https://cl.ly/saVu)” and send a screenshot of your console?

For the moment I can’t load application list

Yep, same thing happened to me. I’m using Windows 7. I wanted to post my setup
log, but the forum is telling me new users can’t post more than 2 links. I’m
not trying to post any links, just my setup log, but that can’t be done.
Anyway, my log ends the way most other people’s logs end:

If you install an old version - it works fine. But there’s no upgrade or
update function in the app and if you try to install a newer version
afterwards it doesn’t work either.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that I get “Error” when I try to install the programm. In the
description (Along long text…) I can read something like:  
…CheckForUpdateImpl: Couldn’t write out staging user ID, this user probably
shouldn’t get beta anything: System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not
find a part of the path
‘C:\Users\Suse\AppData\Local\browserX\packages.betaId’.  
at [System.IO](http://System.IO).Error.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode, String
maybeFullPath)…  
I use the windows 7 system. May it be to old? Or what can be the problem?

I’m glad you are adding boomerang on this but I cannot use it on any gmail
accounts after i activate it.

Whats even worse, I can only go in a google page talking on google calandar
when i want to do anything.

I hope it will be right soon.

(since im a new user i can only include one image here. pls tell me if i
need to cap more in different situations.)

Thanks a lot!

We use Boomerang (the email app for reminding, etc. email sends). Looks like
Boomergang is not working ‘within’ Station.

It’s a plug-in to Gmail. Of course works fine if I use Gmail in the browser.

Anyone else need that functionality within Station?

Boomerang extension works fine in Station, but the Respondable feature (live
stats on email drafts) does not – the clickable box to open Respondable at the
bottom of the draft stays grayed out and when clicked doesn’t show live stats
(word count, etc., stays at 0). Works fine with when Gmail is accessed in
Chrome, so it’s not an issue with the gmail/boomerang account.

1 - went to station log : /Users/Guillaume/Library/Logs/Station/log.log  
2 - Saw this error : [2018-07-10 15:54:22.052] [error] [APP DATA] Error:

Now everything works fine.

 The issue I’m facing is:  
Over the past week, whenever I try to launch Station it remains as a
blank/white screen and nothing loads. Occasionally when I restart my computer
I can see my tabs briefly and then it appears to die again and go blank. I’ve
uninstalled/reinstalled, validated that I’m on the latest version. Can’t
figure out what’s going on here other than posting some of the ambigious
errors in the developer tools.

I have reason to believe this might come from Skype or a broken skype
connection as I can see a request is going out to skype on load (might have
been my last open application before station broke). However, I can’t
validate.

  

Here’s the detailed report

I have the same issue. It appears that the Station App does not allow you to
remove your google account, it only allows you to “logout” but it still keeps
your login information in a seperate file that persists through deleting the
Station App.

This needs to be changed, as it means that you can’t really use this type of
app at work, if you ever plan on leaving that company, since you login will
be kept in that computer after you leave the company.

Please help!

I found a fix (at least on a Mac computer which is what I use, and what the
issue occurred with).

How to Completely log out (ie delete your account from Station):

  1. Open up a finder window, and in the menu bar at the top of the screen click on the menu: “Go”
  2. Once this menu opens hold down the “option” button and a hidden “Library” option will appear.
  3. Click on this ""Library button, and once it opens, find and open the folder “Application Support”
  4. Inside this folder, you should find another folder titled: “Station” this is where your login information and preferences are stored.
  5. Delete this folder, and empty the trash.  
That’s it, when you open the station app back up, it will ask for fresh
account information (meaning your account information is gone).

Hope this helps someone

I checked all windows 10 settings and my “do not disturb mode” on windows 10
is clearly desactivated…  
Why is the “do not disturb” mode then still active on station?

Thanks for your help!

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that …

Audio notifications are not working. I tried to toggle notifications on and
off , tried to change settings, reinstalled, add a exclusion in my antivirus
and changed my focus assist settings.

I only get normal notifications without sound and its so frustrating because
im trying for so long. It once worked when I reinstalled it but after my
restart it did not anymore and tried and tried again it did not work.

It tells me that my focus assist is still on BUT ITS NOT!!!

Hello again, I found a solution, at least for me it worked:

  1. The problem  
Station most certainly uses ‘windows-quiet-hours’ module to check if the user
is using or not quiet hours. [Module
Here](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-quiet-hours)  
This module is not checking the correct registry key in windows. Thus never
knowing if it’s on or off.

  2. Partial Solution  
Go to Registry Editor and put the value that it erroneously checks to 1:  
Computer\HKEYCURRENTUSER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Notifications\Settings  
Put NOCGLOBALSETTINGTOASTSENABLED to 1

Hope it works for you.

Hi [@alexivanoff12](/u/alexivanoff12), maybe you have other problems, I loaded
the Module that I talked in (1), and debugged from there, if you wanna give it
a try I can help you.

I don’t think this will be solved in the future, unless they stop using this
feature of knowing if the OS is in DND or not. The new “Focus Assist” is a bit
diferent in terms of architeture.

Hey [@JuliaMorrongiello](/u/juliamorrongiello),

You can uninstall Station the same way as any other app.

   On Windows 10: <https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-uninstall-an-app-or-program-in-windows-10/>
   On Mac OS: <https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/uninstall-software-apps-mac-3463412/>
   On Linux: just remove the AppImage and delete the `~/.config/Station folder`. On some systems a file could have been created in `~/.local/share/applications` (usually called `appimagekit-station.desktop`): that can also be removed.

Hope this helps.

The Linux uninstall doesn’t seem to work for me. I wanted to uninstall because
I ran it the first time from ./Downloads/ and didn’t want to keep it there.
The first time I ran it there was a pop-up about integrating with the system.
I could also pin the app icon to the ubuntu dock.  
After deleting the appImage and the .config/Station directory and downloading
the image again: when starting the app I did not get the pop up and I cannot
pin the icon to the dock. So it seems something is persisting from the
previous “installation”!?

[@PhilLarsenDonnelly](/u/phillarsendonnelly) On some systems a file could
have been created in `~/.local/share/applications` (usually called

I did not want to reset Station, so I solved this the following way:

  1. Download DB Browser for SQLite: <https://sqlitebrowser.org/>
  2. Find your Station database. For me it was C:\Users\myUsername\AppData\Roaming\Station\db\station.db
  3. Open the database in DB Browser.
  4. Click on the servicesData table and click Modify Table, and rename the manifestURL column. For me there was no data in it. I renamed it to manifestURLservicesData.
  5. Click Write Changes.
  6. Open Station. After it opens you will see there is a new manifestURL column in servicesData, so I think the problem was that Station was trying to create a new manifestURL column in servicesData when one already exists.

[@Alexandre](/u/alexandre) I think this should be an easy fix, and we can’t be
the only two users with this problem.

Thanks, resetting my profile did help. But that is not a fix for the actual
bug.

AFAIK I changed nothing to my Station settings. I updated & rebooted my Mac
last night, on opening Station, it maybe did an update or something else went
wrong.

The fix for the bug could be implemented in the next version of Station.  
For now we just have to wait and see if they fix it

The same phenomenon occurred with the osx app.  
So I deleted the file `/Users/me/Library/Application\
Support/Station/db/station.db` and was able to launch it.  
Unfortunately, this way data is lost.  
I expect this bug to be fixed for all users.

Seeing the same thing, but with some additional connotations. Here’s the
report I was starting:

I’m seeing the same Google account duplicated twice in the list of available
accounts for Google services.

This began occurring after I added another Google account and attempted to
sign into different Google services with different Google accounts in the same
Station account (i.e. sign in to Gmail with my work email address, sign in to
Google Keep with my personal email address)

This caused unstable behaviour (Email account switching over to personal email
account from work email account), so I tried to remove the personal email
address from the list of options.

After it was removed, my work email shows up twice in the list of email
addresses.

Additional note: I am seeing some behaviour that would indicate that I am
still signed in to my personal Google account even though Station is
indicating I am not. For example, I access a Google Sheet and go to mention
another user in a comment, and I get autocompleted users from my personal
gmail account and not from work

Is there a solution to this? I have accidentally added the same gmail account
twice… now i cannot get rid of it… i cannot even REMOVE / DELETE an account.
The “remove app” link does nothing… i uninstalled and re-installed… it just
keeps coming back. How do I remove accounts? This is nuts if you cannot even

SUMMARY  
your need in one sentence

As a user, I want to be able to remove an account that I added so that I don’t
feel uncomfortable or insecure that Station is still holding onto my account
login or permissions.

GIVE US CONTEXT  
Tell us about the current experience

When I add an account, I can only turn it off when I no longer need it (such
as in the Gmail app). I cannot remove the app from the list.

️ PROVIDE DETAILS  
Tell us what you are looking to change

I’d like to have the option to remove an account.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT  
How would it change your experience

The main advantages for me are:

   Security: knowing that Station is not holding onto my credentials.
   Flexibility: having the ability to try new apps or experiences without worrying that Station is doing something that I don’t want.
   Control: control over access to my accounts.

The first thing you can try is right clicking inside the problematic page.  
You should get a menu that looks like this:  
  
In this menu click on “Reset Current Application”  
This could solve the problem.

Another way of solving this would be “Resetting” your station.  
But you will have to reconfigure your Station afterwards.  
You can find the guide on how to do this here:

loads correctly, but in the main window it only shows the message that I

Brief description of the issue

Station won’t start, it stuck at :Your Station will be ready soon"" screen. It
worked fine after most recent update, but all of the sudden today it stuck on
that screen and won’t load. The only thing that comes to mind, that’s
different from last time I opened Station and it worked - is Python. I
installed Python 3.7.2 for Windows x64, which I didn’t have before at all.
Including some packages using pip. That’s the only thing I can think of. There
seems to be an error in console related to Appcues/analytics.min.js.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that …

When I open station, I see “Hi Simon! Your station will be ready soon…” but
after several minutes/hours nothing changes. I can’t open any apps. None of
the buttons in the UI on the left hand side get rid of the “… ready soon …”
page, but the different apps do enter an active state when I click on them.

Interestingly, if I choose “Detach current application” the window which opens
does load the app correctly.

I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling station and that does not solve the
issue.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that …  
On starting up Station, I get a message saying “Hi Jervis! your Station will
be ready soon…”, but nothing happens, all app screens just remain that way.

I tried quitting station, going to %AppData% and deleting the Station folder
and restarting Station and it worked, but after I logged into my accounts and
restarted Station, it reverted back to the same problem. Basically, every time
I want to use Station, I’ll have to continually delete the %AppData% Station
folder and start again.

However, Station does work when I detach an app via Alt+Shift+X… But that’s
still inconvenient.

This is a really cool app, and I’ll be sad to see it unusable. Thanks for any
help.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that whenever I close Station, it opens up and stays stuck on
the “Your station will be ready soon” screen, no matter what tab I go to. It
shows up on the Taskbar as well as in the Task Manager, but no matter how long
I wait for it, it doesn’t load.

I guess I’m in the same case. I can get Station to work properly but when I
reboot my pc, Station has just been deleted. Moreover, when I try to launch
the exe setup installer, it does nothing and delete it right away. This can
only be the act of my antivirus.  
This is very inconvenient as I have to redownload the installer from the site
and reinstall Station each time I get away from my pc. We need a fix for that
!

Same on my side on two different computers. On both of them I use avast and it

After six months came back to try this again, but still Microsoft Windows
Defender blocks install. Would love to evaluate this, but not against with
this warning

I am running Windows 10 Enterprise Version 1903 Build 18362.175 and the
current browserX-Setup-1.43.2.exe

I evaluate and use lots of software, but very little has this sort of issue.
This includes most open source and small utilities from single independent
developers, and apps using the same Electron/Nodejs framework. I am rather
disturbed that this has been a long running issue without a fix or comments
from the Station developers.

Later…

I see there is a FAQ about this claiming that this is the fault of the
antivirus blockers. Still, I have never seen an app from an organization like
Station (with YCombinator backing no less) have this type of problem for more
than a couple weeks, (or release build).

Is there a way to Remove a custom Company Application

I was testing out adding a Custom App and added to as a Company App. I was

One of my applications, Paypal, doesn’t have its application name and if I

appears with the white screen, and I cannot do anything before restarting

I’ve tried several times to uninstall and reinstall station, but It doesn’t

name in the preference setting at station app, there is no pop-up window for

the app with no-name still there.

Brief description of the issue

A few days ago a “rogue” icon appeared on my left bar. It is just a circle, no
icon inside, and on the options page for my apps, it has no information there.
The delete button here does nothing, neither do the toggles or the refresh
button.  
So, I am unable to remove it. mousing over it kills station by whiting it all
out also. Opening the dev console after this happens, it destroys all the
HTML, removing everything from within the

. The body, after having moused over this circle, contains the root div, 3
scripts, and 2 more blank divs.

  

Mandatory details

   Trigger — Not sure what caused this rogue icon in the first place, though the most recent addition I put was lastpass, and lastpass disappeared at the same time this appeared. I have since re-added lastpass and so far no second icon. The trigger for whiting out is mousing over the circle.

   Issue — As described above really.

Hi [@Paresh](/u/paresh)!

We should have the feature of editing/deleting ready early this week  
In the meantime, if you want me to delete them before, you can DM me which
apps you want to delete.

Hello everyone!

You can now edit or delete custom apps ! You’ll find a new “pen icon” on
hover of your custom apps.  
  
Bonus, you can select an icon instead of an image for you custom apps

This happens when you didn’t close a download/print page you had previously
opened (usually in Gmail, Gdrive or Slack). Now every time you restart
Station, the page is refreshed and triggers the prompt.

To get rid of that you’ll just have to scout your subdock and close unused
pages.

Tell me how it goes.

I have 3 email accounts on Station, and I want to use the hunter mailtracker

second and third accounts, it wants me to activate the mailtracker. This does
not happen within Station though, it happens in my browser. My browser then
wants me to install the hunter app for the browser, which does nothing for me

As a heavy Asana user, I want to be able to click on an attached document in a
task and have it open in a browser window to view (without downloading it) so
that every time I need to refer to an attached document, I don’t re-download a
whole new copy of it.

When I use Asana in a regular browser, I can click on a document attached to
task, and it opens it in a new browser tab so that I can view it (I’m talking
about pdfs, and images - things that can easily be viewed in a browser without
opening a specialized program like Photoshop or Excel). I do this a lot in my
workflow when I need to refer to a document while I’m working on a task.

However, when I use Asana in Station, clicking a document in a task does not
open the file in a window to view, but rather downloads it to my hard drive. I
would like to be able to view the document - when I need to refer to it
several times, I don’t want to download multiple copies of it. It does not
matter to me if the tab opened in Station or took me to my browser.

The main advantages for me are:

   This is a huge part of my workflow and I cannot continue to use Asana in Station if I have to download an attachment every time I want to view it.

   . I keep Asana open at all times and use it all day. I would love to be able to keep it in my Station dashboard.

   This will help with my document management - I won’t have multiple copies of the same thing downloaded to my downloads folder.

Hey there

I’m having a hard time reproducing this bug on Station 1.39.2. and gonna need
your help

  1. Does it freeze completely or simply lags?
  2. Is the issue systematic or only appears from time to time?
  3. Does it occur only in Gmail or everywhere there’s a text input?
  4. Do you have a specific action that triggers the bug?
  5. How often do you restart your computer (on average)? Did you restart it recently?
  6. On which OS are you?

Thanks a lot for your answers.

My bad, still happens in 1.39.2

It only happens in GMail with large threads and I also think it only happens
when I have people that user other email clients answer (Outlook I think).  
Maybe it has something to do with the markup composition of the email?

  2. Systematic with long email threads with non GMail users.

  5. Haven’t restarted it recently but did restart Station and it keeps happening.

Is there any way for me to disable spell-check and see if it keeps happening.

Hey Georges,

I am on the verge of abandoning Station because of this bug. I noticed it
first some time early this year (1.38.1 I believe). And it has remained
consistently through the updates. I am on 1.40.1, and it is still there. Not
easy to reproduce, but I will try to give you some info.

  1. It lags, but the lag can be very long (up to 15-20 seconds), so that you have the impression that it is frozen.
  2. The issue is systematic on some email threads. i.e. I can reply to a small thread without problem. and when I open a problematic thread, gmail will lag unbearably in station, so I need to switch back to chrome to answer.
  3. I noticed the freeze only in Gmail for me. But the lag is across accounts. I can open the same problematic thread in two different gmail accounts on station, and it will lag in both.
  4. Simply typing text is what causes the lag.
  5. Restarted the computer yesterday.
  6. OS 10.14.4

I suspect it is a visualisation issue of varying formats.

-> I tried to reproduce in an artificial thread (3 adresses exchanging, 20 replies, 1 attachment of 2 Go, 1 Gdrive link, 1 non gmail address), but this one stays fluid. So I am a bit at odds of what it is exactly.

-> I copied one problematic thread in a brand new email, and the issue appeared. The freezing became less and less long as I gradually removed attachments, images, formatting, length, layers.

Hope that helps. If you have any other ideas for how I can help to narrow down
the problem, let me know.

I couldnt agree more! Im about to switch back to Franz. It is not as good but
it never glitches out like this.

Literally 1/3 times i tap on the program, i have to wait a couple minutes for
it to unfreeze.

Im using Mojave on a 15inch 2017 Macbook Pro Touchbar. Its a beast. No reason
this shitty little app shouldnt be working.

Tried to force reproduce the problem but its too unpredictable.

I’m on a 2018 15"" MBP Touchbar - and have started having the same issue. I am
on the latest version of Station as well - and have configured 12 services in
total. Next time this happens, I will shunt Station and move to the forked
Wavebox - which seems to be producing nightlies and is also on the latest
Electron, etc.

Thanks a lot for your very thorough answers! We are working on improving

happen? (View > Developer > Toggle Page Developer Tools > Console). That would

My problem is that, ever since the last update (Version 1.41.1) Gmail crashes
every 10-15 minutes. When I click in “Try Reloading” the whole Station

I’ve just moved from Franz to Station, but I’m also suffering this huge issue
of slowing down while writing emails on Gmail.

My version is 1.43.2 and my Macbook Pro is running on Mojave 10.14.5.

If you don’t resolve this bug soon I’m leaving right now. Gmail is the most
critical app I’m using on Station.

I have the same experience using v 1.43.2.  
It is not a total freeze, but a huge delay, which makes typing an email a
pain.

The message or the thread is not even long (3-4 emails), but I experience a
long delay: after clicking the mouse to put my insertion point somewhere else
and I start typing, the text ends up on the old position - and messes up the
message.  
Selecting text by double clicking with the mouse is either very slow or does
not work.

I tried to disable the spell checker but can’t seem to find the setting
anywhere, only to activate it. I don’t use it anyway, so if disabling it would
take away this problem, I would favor that.

Thanks for looking into this. I appreciate it that you are committed to making
such a great app even better! I am very pleased with the many things I can do
with Station.

Warm regards,  
Dirk

OS: Mac OS Sierra  
Generally, clicks do not register well in Station.It’ll take 2, 3 presses of
buttons before the app responds. It’s annoying yes, but it’s also critical in
things like gmail “Did it send that email, is the app hanging up or working?”  
The app is great guys, I like the idea but it not registering clicks on the
first go is forcing me to go back to chrome for a variety of tasks.

I thought it was a processes/ram issue but have been able to recreate this
while only station is open.

Brief description of the issue

When switching between workspaces, the focus is not given to the new
workspace.

Example repro steps:

  1. Load a Slack workspace, send a message
  2. Switch to a Gmail workspace (using mouse)
  3. Hit “u” to jump to inbox/check mail

Expected result:  
Gmail should have focus and hitting “u” should apply the keyboard shortcut to
the web application.

Actual result:  
Station has focus and the keyboard shortcut is lost. What’s worse, is that if
the user uses the keyboard shortcut in Station to switch workspaces (i.e.
CMD+2) instead of the mouse, then the previous workspace keeps the focus and
hitting “u” sends the input to the previous application. I have many times
entered “uuuu” into Slack (previously focused workspace) while looking at
Gmail (new, just switched-to workspace). Very frustrating.

I’ve just upgraded to version 1.43.1 and am having issues with the cursor
disappearing mid-sentence. I’ve tested it across Google Docs, Slack Messenger,
WhatsApp and Todoist and in all of them, the cursor will disappear and nothing
will be typed mid-sentence.

I have to click back in the input field to get the cursor back. I can type
another 5-10 words before it happens again. I’ve checked the keyboard, it’s
fine, and this issue is not happening anywhere outside of Station.

I am experiencing this same issue. Doesn’t matter what app I’m in (slack,
gmail, fb messenger and whatsapp which is currently not working at all and
stuck in an update loop), the text field I’m typing in loses focus and I am
unable to continue typing. The time is takes to lose focus is variable and it
can also happen while typing quickly.

I first noticed it when using slack to type work messages and my type stream
would cut out. I can click the field or cmd + tab + tab to regain focus but
both of those options are not ideal.

I also have several focus problems., mostly in Slack.  
I also noticed, that the focus of input fields gets lost and I have to click
on the input field again.  
More annoying though is that when I have any other window focused and want to
click on a link in Slack open in Station, I have to click once to get focus on
station and then klick again for the link to be opened.  
That’s not how Chrome behaves, it just opens the link even if it has no focus.  
I’m on Linux Arch 5.2.5 with Cinnamon 4.2.3 and Station is v1.44.1

It really gets in the way if you want to open 3 links one after the other,
because the focus is always switched to Chrome after opening one of them.

- but it’s the personal account that won’t sign in.

One way I was able to resolve this issue was to log into another service with
Google Auth (like Trello, in my case) and then re-attempt to log into gmail.
Since Station is a browser, once you log into another app (apps are like
tabs), you should be authenticated among other apps.

Using Office 365 from Station, I expected the various apps to open within the
Station environment. Instead, they open in my default browser, each opening a
new tab. If the idea of Station is to give me an integrated work environment,
I don’t want to be taken out of that environment by any of the integrated

Same here. Add new Office365 app, and there is no way to have the Outlook or

Just keeps open them in a default browser.

I have this same issue on Windows 7. It is actually the same error I get when
trying to launch Slack as well. The Slack people told me it may be related to
my User Profile being on a drive that uses lowercase lettering. I haven’t
tested their offered solution as I’m not able to modify the registry on my
work machine.

The response from Slack:

I was recommended this app from a friend and broke the app, apparently
irreversibly, almost immediately. After download and sign in, the app wouldn’t
let me move it, I could resize the window, but grabbing at the top wouldn’t
let me move it. the only thing that resulted was if i grabbed it in a certain
spot in the top right corner it extracted an apparently blank .txt doc to my
desktop, i pulled the doc back into the window to see if it would open or if I
could deduct what was happening. Once I did that my email tab showed this
error log screen (linked below) failing to find this blank .txt document in my
file structure for some reason. after multiple quit and restarts and even two
uninstall and re-downloads, my email page will only show this error message.
Pretty surprised by the breakability of this app, but hoping to get it working
as it is something that I want to like.

The first thing you can try is right clicking inside the tab with problems.  
You should get a menu that looks like this:  
  
In this menu click on “Reset Current Application”  
This could solve the problem.

Another way of solving this would be “Resetting” your station.  
But you will have to reconfigure your Station afterwards.  
You can find the guide on how to do this here:

Hello, I discovered Station yesterday and want to say firstly I think it’s a
huge step in the right direction for an improved work experience.

I work in an environment where I need to work on battery for most of my day
and I did notice that today I wasn’t able to make it past noon while using my
MacBook. Typically I’d get about 5 - 5.5 hours. I only managed about 3.5 - 4…
The only difference was I used Station instead of chrome.

Also, there seems to be some noticeable lag when I type. I’ve only typed in
gmail and docs so far.

Thanks and keep up the great work!

The issue I’m facing is …

Significant consumption; avg. energy impact is ~40 after several hours of
steady use. Unit is always quite warm to touch and total battery life is cut
by a third. To note, the footprint seems to roughly mirror usage of Chrome,
which I find quite taxing on my system as well.

Love this app. At this rate, I might switch back to running a series of pinned
tabs in Safari. Would be really great if you guys could figure out how to make
this a power sipper; truly one app to rule them all.

After doing some research, there is a flag --disable-gpu for electron that
accomplishes this. On macOS, you can start Station with this flag (not sure if
it actually passes through, but so far results are promising) by using the
command  
`open /Applications/Station.app/ --args --disable-gpu`

It seems like “open /Applications/Station.app/ --args --disable-gpu” works to
disable the discrete gpu.

Why hasn’t Station made that the default when launching?

Doesn’t it bother you guys that people are trying Station then abandoning it
because it kills their battery? I recommended station to a number of people
who went through this cycle and gave up on it

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that …  
Font rendering on Windows 10 with Intel Iris 6100 GPU (running dual boot on
MacBook Pro 13’’ early-2015) is poor (type is blurry) when using hardware
acceleration. I’ve found this issue multiple times in many different software
applications, and the solution is almost always to turn off graphics hardware
acceleration.  
Is there a way to enable hardware acceleration to become an option in
Station’s Options menu?

It looks like electron can perform this:
<https://electronjs.org/docs/all#appdisablehardwareacceleration>, but not
without it being built into the app? There also seems to be a discussion here:
<https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/13368>. This thread also
identifies the issue: <https://communities.intel.com/thread/127903>

Will try, but it sucks to have to spend the time to readd all the apps.

In terms of UX/product this should be improved. Cause if it takes someone more
time to delete a folder and reconfigure everything than it takes to uninstall
completely station, one might feel enticed to do so.

UPDATE : wasn’t that bad. Station found many of the apps I was already using.

I completely reset my Station setup. Then I clicked a link to Bookface, it

I’m having a hard time reproducing this bug: even when I have Meet & Chat

  1. Are you sure that it is those apps that trigger the webcam in Station?
  2. Have you tried removing them and adding them again?
  3. Can you record your screen with your phone and show us how the webcam is off and the goes on after installation?

I can confirm it happens without chat too, I did most recently add chat to my

further inspection it doesn’t seem to be related to any of my apps, after
recording this video I proceeded to uninstall Facebook Messenger, Discord, and
Slite and it still occurred exactly how it shows in the video

<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1axlKGzG9HUjuuJsCIHkJRlv7HQ8ZhEyp>

Other apps installed are Google Inbox (3 accounts), Slack (2 workspaces),
Google Drive, and Todoist. My guess at this point is that it’s still related
to google somehow, as I can receive google chats while in any of their
services.

camera turns off. When I launch, camera will turn on after a few minutes. I’ve

Same problem here, using Station 1.51.1 with the Hangout plugin on.

When I open the app (first thing I do in the morning), it turns the webcam on
right away. And sometimes (I didn’t manage to find a pattern) the camera is
turned off after a while.

If I remove the Hangout plugin, it works ok.

I love Station, but this is obviously a huge security concern.

Hello!

Nice work with Station, thanks and congratulations!

About this request… What about if you can select an specific app (or more than
one app) to use his notifications also in the Station icon?

Imagine I enable this feature for my Gmail app (enable all my gmail
notifications for Station icon). So, every time I receive an email, I’ll see
the notification in the Station icon inside the Windows Taskbar.

Sometimes, if I don’t have the headphones in my work, I don’t see the
notifications until I open Station. It would be super useful if we can use the
icon to see this specific notifications.

Thanks!

I have multiple Slack channels and am in tons and tons of channels in each.
None of them give me a direct notification in Slack (one where the channel
lights up with a number), unless someones @'s me. So at any given time I may
have 5-10 channels that are lit up in Slack, but nothing urgent that I need to
attend to.

It drives me nuts that Station still puts the red badge on the Slack apps
though. I fill compelled to go and make sure I didn’t miss anything, only to
see it’s just some bot room. I know I can mute the channel completely, but
that’s not really the use case. I’d love to be able to only see a badge on
Slack if someone direct messaged me.

 SUMMARY (your need in one sentence)

I want notification sounds to be recognized as such by the OS so they can be
controlled separately from system audio.

GIVE US CONTEXT (tell us about the current experience)

Currently whenever one of the Station web apps has an alert sound (Slack, for
instance) it comes through the OS as a normal audio source.

PROVIDE DETAILS (tell us what you are looking to change)

I’d like those alerts to be treated as “sound effects” by the OS. If they
can’t be separated, I’d prefer all sounds from Station to be treated as
sound effects.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT (how would it change your experience)

The main advantages for me are:

   Sound effects can be controlled separately from the overall system volume. Different output, different volume, etc. Prevents loud alerts from embarrassingly coming through during a presentation.

SUMMARY  
One Sentence Summary  
Provide setting to only show Slack badge notification if I’m directly
addressed.

In my Slack desktop client, I set notification settings such that a badge and
popup only appears when I’m being directly addressed (via the various
“at”-commands). Any other activity (people just talking in a channel) does not
generate a badge or popup and as such does not disturb my flow. This setting
is called “Direct messages, mentions & keywords”)

This is finer control than outright muting channels or muting the entire Slack
client altogether: If someone specifically targets me, I will get notified.
And if new activity occurs in a channel, then in the client itself I still get
that white bold-face highlight, so I see that there’s new stuff whenever I
take a break to check the Slack client.

GIVE US CONTEXT  
Tell us about the current experience

The “Direct messages, mentions & keywords” setting is accessible from the
“Preferences” menu of Slack within Station, but Station does not honor it:
Even with this setting, I will get a notification badge from Station whenever
there is any new message in any channel that I’m a member off, even if I am
NOT directly mentioned.

PROVIDE DETAILS  
Tell us what you are looking to change

I’d like for Station to honor the notification settings of Slack. If I pick
the “Only notify me when I’m directly mentioned,…” setting, then a badge and
desktop notification should only be generated when this happens, and NOT when
there is ANY new message in some channel.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT  
How would it change your experience

Until this is fixed, I won’t be adding Slack to Station, which unfortunately
means I’m missing out on the larger integration, such as having Google Drive
links from within Slack also open inside Station.

Hi [@ShirleyLin](/u/shirleylin) thanks for reporting the issue.

We rather think that the issue appeared after you updated from Station 1.25 to
1.26. This is a known issue [1] between Electron 3 (the framework Station is
built upon) and Magnet and that is being handled. However I don’t have any
timeline of when this issue will be solved.

Fortunately, there is small workaround: if you toggle Station’s full screen
mode on and then off, Magnet will work with Station.

Regarding the Cmd+W, what did you expect it to do? Is that a shortcut of
Magnet or something else?

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that … Typical Mac UI allows you to click the close, minimize,
or maximize buttons in the top left corner of the window without having to
make that window active. With Station, if I’m working in another window and
want to close Station, I first have to click on the station window to make it
active, and then close it out, which is a hassle.

SUMMARY  
Your need in one sentence

As a user, I want to use manage my Station App window in the same way that I
manage all other application windows on my machine—using a window management
app (I use Magnet)—so that I can quickly move station to a desired area of my
desktop screen.

GIVE US CONTEXT  
Tell us about the current experience

When I use the global hotkeys enabled by Magnet app to resize Station, Station
does not respond at all; in other words, the window size does not react at
all. Station is the only application on my computer that does not work with
Magnet—my best guess as a developer is that it has something to do with the
way you’re using a custom top bar, but Slack also has a custom hidden top bar,
and it still works.

PROVIDE DETAILS  
Tell us what you are looking to change

I’d like Station to work with window management applications just like every
other app does.

DESCRIBE THE IMPACT  
How would it change your experience

The main advantages for me are:

   Ease of use—either full screen experience or quickly put my email side-by-side with an important PDF I might be viewing in another app.
   Power use—because window management is a power user thing

Hi,

I would love for Station to be compatible with Magnet or some of the other
window pane apps within MacOS in order for users to easily split their screen
between two apps. With Station, I sometimes have the ability, but not always.
If Station incorporated this and Grammarly into a paid service I would pay to
become a premium user!

Thank You,  
Daurys

Echoing [@loudmouth](/u/loudmouth)’s report from above:

The fact that Station doesn’t work with Magnet (using version 1.37.2
currently) is the biggest problem with Station.

I’m not sure why it doesn’t work but as a power user I prefer to use the
keyboard short cuts to automatically resize my windows. It is super
frustrating to have to clumsily click and drag to resize station every time I
need to move it around the screen.

security I have been using at Habitica since forever (i.e., Facebook login),
Station doesn’t let me access Habitica, hence for me Station has not

Ok, we’ll have to investigate this. We indeed have an issue with link
redirects.

One solution would be to correctly “catch” the link sent to you by mail so
that it opens in Station instead of your default browser: could you right
click on the URL sent to you by mail, click on “Copy link Address” and send
me the link?

this screen. It is impossible to use your app because of this and the other
bug I posted - CMD C and V were not working, also we have special lethers in
Latvian where we need to use ’ to activate them, but that is also not working
in google drive integration. Will have to leave your app

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that I tried to upload an icon for a new app I was requesting
and pasted it in the app and not the respective upload field. Since then the
“+” Page is broken and there is no way to fix it. I can’t request new apps
anymore

Hi [@ClaudioRicci](/u/claudioricci) ,

I looked around a bit and found two ways to fix the problem.

The first thing you can try is right clicking inside the “+” page.  
You should get a menu that looks like this:  
  
In this menu click on “Reset Current Application”  
This could solve the problem.

Another way of solving this would be “Resetting” your station.  
But you will have to reconfigure your Station afterwards.  
You can find the guide on how to do this here:  
[faq.getstation.com](https://faq.getstation.com/bugs-and-glitches/how-can-i-
get-a-fresh-start-on-my-station)

I’m seeing this as well. I also end up with a blank window that has popped up
in the background (or left over from the login?) that does nothing as well.

Here is a GIF. When the mouse goes off screen it’s because I’m clicking my
google account in the popup. I bring the blank gray window mentioned in to

[@JayMeistrich](/u/jaymeistrich) thanks for digging into this!

Yes, Firebase signin and Electron seems to [not

I think the underlying issue is the management of popup window, [esp. in
iframe](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/9533).

That being said, I was able to teak the configuration for Moodo
(`useNativeWindowOpen`) to get it work and it will be released and working at

Same issue. I’m actually a new user who has never used Station before, and on

There’s a bunch of 404’s in the electron dev tools console, all surrounding

It would appear that app.asar did not unpack itself properly, as the only

with only a single `nodemodules` within.

The issue I’m facing is …  
the UI for JIRA and Confluence is not loading correctly when accessed via
Station. The problem is not reproducible via browser.

The UI is such that the font style is different, some elements do not load,
and formatting causes parts of the site to be inaccessible. I have attempted
to delete/remove the JIRA application and “reinstall”, as well as log out
completely and back into the application.

## The last time this was working correctly for me was Friday, March 23. I did
not use the software again until Wednesday, March 28. That is when I noticed
the problem.

Here’s the detailed report

This happens for me as well. I have two monitors so I will have station up on
one monitor. I then am working on something on the second screen. I decide I
need something that is behind Station on the first screen, so without
activating Station I just click the minimize button.

Unlike every other application in the world that immediately minimizes,
Station starts to minimize but then realizes it didn’t have my full attention
so it comes back and I have to click minimize again.

This is the one of the most frustration thing in the world. Please fix it
immediately.

I think that the quickest way of solving this right now would be “Resetting”
your station.  
But you will have to reconfigure your Station afterwards.

times a day that I stopped using Station for a while until I found that
disabling Gmelius solved the issue.  
Still a few crashes but much less and Station keeps running after crash error
message (very strange behavior).  
Maybe it could help : I’ve got 5 gmail accounts and 17 other apps (Slack,
Google Drives, Calendars, ClikUp, Polymail, Coda, Notion…)

And I must admit : Station rocks !! so it is very hard to get away from it

I can confirm.  
With the gmelius extension active, composing new emails and replying to emails
(especially long threads) causes CPU spike and eventually a blue “can’t load
gmail” screen. Clicking reload closes (crashes) station entirely.  
Once the gmelius extension is disabled, no more crashes.  
I’ve seen lines in the console mentioning gmelius pinging home to check if I
was on a paid account, but I’m not sure this is related.

Hi!

Guys, you really need to check Gmelius addon.

– I haven’t experienced this very specific expression of this issue, but
Basecamp does just log me out regularly.

Workflowy does so even more frequently, and is more cumbersome to log back
into.

Both of these issues have been at play for me since Station’s PH debut, when I
started using it.

All 13 other apps I use in Station are totally fine, and don’t have this
issue.

Hopeful for a fix to these issues in a release in the near future!

side bar, hitting the add apps button brings me a list which has gmail in it

This is basic functionallity that needs to be resolved ASAP. Station really
has no use case when you have no idea when a new message has arrived other
than looking at the global notification icon (bottom left).

We need to see what apps have unread messages agaisnt them without having to
click into things. This works fine in Rambox (and also has a counter), so
should be workable for Station

Hi Maud,

Your SQL solution worked for me (I had to change the path a bit on the command

I was able to stop and restart Station without issues, restart my laptop and

I just download the last version and it works fine as well, but I couldn’t say
if it’s because of the SQL permissions I set before !

I’ll dig up this conversation if I ever have anything new in the future.

Thank you for your help !

Hello,

I am writing in French from a French Canadian keyboard on Google Doc and the
special characters like ê or ù are not working within Station. It works
perfectly on the same Google Doc outside Station.

The issue I’m facing is:  
I use the accented character shortcuts to type accented characters, for
example using a US Qwerty keyboard I type option-e then press e to type the
character é. Or option-` then press a to type à.

This behavior works on all apps in OSX, but but intermittently it will not
work in Station. I type option-e then press e, and the character observed is
e. The character expected is é.

Same issue for long press. When I press the key e for 2 seconds, I expect to
see a list of different accented characters that can be typed. The
intermittently observed behavior in Station is that it will instead type
eeeeee.

This issue is intermittent but I have not yet found a reliable workaround. It
completely prevents me from typing in French in Station when I encounter this
issue (because I have a Qwerty keyboard).

Thanks for your help,  
Chris

The issue I’m facing is: When I try to log in to Todoist, nothing happens. I
install Todoist, click “log in” on the Todoist site, and then click to sign in
with my Google account. But nothing happens. The Google account sign in screen
won’t open.

For others facing this issue, I found a workaround:

  1. Install Todoist
  2. Open Todoist in Station
  3. In the Todoist website header, right click “log in”
  4. Choose “open in new page”
  5. This should open the Todoist login popup in its own page
  6. Sign in with your Google account
  7. Now click on the Todoist icon in Station and go back to the Todoist home page
  8. Now click “open web app” in the header of the Todoist site

(Some of the names of the links may be different as described here as I’m
currently logged in and don’t remember the exact details.)

The bottom line is that there seems to be some kind of issue opening the
Google account sign in page from the Todoist login popup, but you can get
around it by opening the popup in its own page.

Hey everyone

This should be fixed in Station’s version 1.17.

Hi Guys,

In google sheets, or in closeio, both within station:

In sheets: In a cell, there is a link to a company profile in linkedin
recruiter (if you do not have a linkedin recruiter account, you must see a
login page):  
<https://www.linkedin.com/recruiter/company/314350>

In closeio: In company description, there is a link to a company profile on
linkedin recruiter

When I click the link, I am sent to my browser (which is good, and thanks for
the update on that), but then the link is corrupted into the following:

`https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login-
cap?sessionredirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fcap%2Fdashboard%2Fhome%2F%3Fsessionredirect%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%252Frecruiter%252Fcompany%252F314350%26destURL%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%252Frecruiter%252Fcompany%252F314350%26destURL%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww%252Elinkedin%252Ecom%252Frecruiter%252Fcompany%252F314350&sourceapp=cap&trk=capsignin`

Which is weird, as I do not get the same problem with links to standard
linkedin profiles.

When using the same link in google sheets or closeio from within chrome, the
problem does not appear.

Thank you

well) on 18.10. However they have already found a solution and in their beta
the problem is solved. Electron has to be updated. Look here:

My issue is very simple : I receive several notifications at the same time, 10
minutes before a given event in google Agenda - the reason is simple : I have
several pages of Google agenda opened at the same time in Station, with

Could it be possible to solve this and have 1 notification sent per event,
whatever the number of windows of Google agenda opened ?

Multiple GCal Notification for Same Meeting/Event 

Just as the topic title reads, I will often get three or four notifications
for meetings/events in GCal. I started checking to the events to see if the
organizers have been playing some kind of trick and building in multiple
alerts, but this isn’t the case. I’ve been living with it but its starting to
drive me crazy hearing the chime back to back to back especially on days where
I have things scheduled all day.

Hi guys,

I was experiencing the same issue as you mention above.  
I recently found a trouble-shoot to deal with this issue and want to share it
with you

> The number of notification you’re getting is link to the number of openned

For instance with the example below, I was getting 3 times notifications for
each event in my calendar - quite anoying…

Hello [@OllyW](/u/ollyw), [@JustinSleight](/u/justinsleight),
[@dlm](/u/dlm), and [@aleprieto](/u/aleprieto),

Thanks a lot for contributing in spite of the bugs🙏  
The problems with Hangout, Meet and Skype, should have been solved since
release 1.3.0. If you’re still experiencing issues, we’re gonna have to
investigate further using:

  1. A brief description of your bug with attached screen recording or screenshots
  2. Your [logs](http://faq.getstation.com/bugs-not-that-we-have-any/facing-a-major-bug-and-find-no-answer-in-this-faq)
  3. Your [Station database](http://faq.getstation.com/bugs-not-that-we-have-any/facing-a-major-bug-and-find-no-answer-in-this-faq)
  4. A screenshot of your activity monitor/task manager while Station’s running

Just send me those 4 ( we need them all ) by direct message & we’ll dig
into your issues.

Have an awesome day!

First of all, thanks for building such an amazing tool! I use it every day.

notifications remaining long after they have already been viewed in Apps.

The biggest culprit is Gmail. Station will believe there are notifications to

I’m having this same issue as well but only when Gmail or Inbox tabs tabs are
active: maybe the current opened page is preventing closing due to some text
being typed?

As much as I like Station, I’m concerned to see such basic functionality not
working as expected. Hopefully this will be addressed very soon.

An alternative to force quitting is to:

  1. Press ⌘-Tab to activate the application switcher
  2. Keep the ⌘ key held down as you Tab over to Station.
  3. Keep the ⌘ key held down as you press the Q key to quit.

Generally speaking, this is a handy way to quit apps on the Mac. If you keep
the ⌘ key held down you can continue to press Tab (to switch) and Q (to quit)
other apps.

Similarly pressing the H key with ⌘ held down hides whichever app is selected.

I just had this problem, but some notes:

  1. When I was trying to close the app, I noticed in the Task Monitor on Mac that there were a LOT of Station Helper processes running, like over 20 of them (I didn’t count exactly).

  3. This doesn’t happen now, after a reboot and starting Station. It seems to be something (for me) more related to having the app open for a long time.

Hey [@Georges](/u/georges),  
Sorry as well for the late answer I haven’t been on the forum in a while.  
Here are 2 gifs, the 1st one is the behaviour in the Evernote app and the 2nd
is what I have in Station.  
Evernote app - notice how after hitting tab I can create elements (checkboxes,
lists)  
  
Evernote in the Station app - the same behaviour doesn’t happen anymore  

I didn’t replicate the table element but it’s basically the same. Tables in
Evernote within Station are as good as useless once you create one, while
they’re surprisingly adjustable in the Evernote app.

It’s not making Station unusable (to me) but it’s lacking and some other
people taking notes everyday won’t let this friction hinder their work
experience and will resort to using to something else.

Hi,

in the leftbar of Evernote I no longer have access to the piles of notebooks I
have created. Meaning I only have an alphabetically order of all my notebooks.
This is useless.  
If you look at the webversion of Evernote (see attached printscreens) I have
the piles.  
If I don’t have the piles in the Station version of Evernote, then station is
useless to me

Hi [@GregoryNoirfalise](/u/gregorynoirfalise) &
[@AntoineBeauvillain](/u/antoinebeauvillain),

It seems you’re comparing Evernote in Station with Evernote’s desktop app.  
Station only hosts web-apps which means that its functionalities should be on-
par with the web version of Evernote (accessible via:
[evernote.com/login.action](http://evernote.com/login.action)).

This is important as there seem to be a huge difference between Evernote
online & desktop versions:

faster, but what besides that am...

Hi guys - Oleg from Coda here.

I actually stumbled upon this thread myself after running into the same issue,
and it turns out that Station is still using an outdated version of Electron
(the embedded version of Chrome used inside Station), but pretending that it’s
running on a modern version.

In fact, if you take a look at the screenshot, Station is running v61 of
Chrome but masquerading itself as running v67. What’s more, the “user agent”
text doesn’t even hint that it’s coming from Station, so we actually can’t
even detect on our end that this isn’t Chrome, leading to the broken behavior
you see here.

""Image%202018-10-17%20at%2011.41.16%20PM.jpg"")

Unfortunately, Coda relies on the security and rendering features of Chrome
v65+, and thus there isn’t much we can do on our end until Station gets
updated to use Electron v3.0 or later.

Although the gradient changing of colors based on the time of the day feels

virtually invisible. I look at the dock and find notification badge glowing,

I am color blind and have a hard time picking up the little red dots used to

different background color. Being able to choose that color would also be nice

If there is one issue with Station right now that is causing me to reconsider
using it (not using it) is the lack of multi-monitor support when I disconnect
from my other screens. So, it works fine when I am connected to 2 external
monitors on my 2017 macbook pro, but when I disconnect from my other monitors
at my office desk to go to a meeting, the way the app situates itself on my
laptop alone is super annoying. The app is present, but I can’t click on it
and bring it to the fore… its like its there, but invisible. Most functioning
apps resize themselves and continue functioning after I “undock” or disconnect
from the other monitors.

Here’s the detailed report

Select the Station app and open it.

Press Alt + Space bar, which will open a menu in windows - navigate to move,
use the cursors to move the Station window back onto the main display.

Solved the issue for me.

Brief description of the issue

I can reproduce a bug. Steps to reproduce:

1- Setup a 3 monitor desktop (I don’t know if it can be reproduced with two).  
2 - Open Station and move it to the third monitor.  
3 - Close Station.  
4 - Disconnect the two extra monitors.  
5 - Open Station again.

As you can see Station is not shown again. It might appear as an opened
program but there is no clue of where the window is.

Any help with this? thanks!

I had a missing main window even after restarting Station a few times. I
looked around a bit and I found that deleting this file (while Station is not
running) worked:

    
    
    $ rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Station/window-state.json
    

its contents were

days since the last time I had a second monitor connected.

Hey [@Snarly](/u/snarly),

That’s an interesting request.  
We chose not to allow autosleep for apps in which core features don’t work
when asleep:

   Noisly: the sounds will turn off automatically
   Slack: notifications won’t work

Could you detail your use case and give us other examples of apps that you’d
like to sleep (and you can’t)?

5ddff9500373063c5d9c8219,"Enable autosleep for all apps / force apps to be disabled in the background
(Noisly, Slack, Telegram, etc.)

","

I guess it might depend on what is meant by ‘sleep’. I’m not a developer, so
my definition of it might be working on different assumptions, but I
understand it to mean that a site is fully loaded and drawing on resources.
I’m just mindful that I don’t want to be accumulating activity that’s
unnecessarily drawing processor or memory, even if it’s relatively small.

In my case, I don’t use Noisly routinely. Instead, I use it occasionally, as
and when I feel I need to. On those occasions, I’d be fine with it running in
the background. But for the vast majority of days and times when I don’t need
to use it, I don’t see a need for it to be running in the background.

With Slack, I’m a member of around twenty (at a guess) groups based on my
interests (so not team-related). Some are more active than others, but
checking in on them or posting in them is an occasional activity for me.
Having 20+ instances of Slack running in the background in my circumstances
seems like it could be an unnecessary draw on resources. I’ve got almost 20
different apps set up on Station already.

Because of the lower frequency of use, it wouldn’t bother me to have a few
seconds of overhead to initialise those apps as and when I want to use them,
and I’d be fine with them running in the background on those occasions (I
understand the rationale for that).

Some responses might be to just open those sites from a browser or native
application instead, but it’s convenient to have Web apps like them contained
and run from something like Station, which is better than accumulating a
collection of separate bookmarks and applications.

Perhaps I’m asking for something slightly different, then: the option to
‘suspend’ an app, if the distinction is more helpful.

The other apps I have set up and would like to suspend (again, because they’re
seldom used) are Skype and Hangouts. I only tend to make or receive calls by
prior arrangement and any spontaneous calls tend to be via WhatsApp.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that the notification sounds for Telegram when on “do not
disturb mode” are always on and can’t disable them. Messenger, Slack, and
Gmail are doing the same as is from the apps I often use.  
I am using Station for a second year and previously didn’t have such an issue.
There was another issue with Station - crashing and then I needed to install
the latest version, now I am with version 1.43.1 and these notifications are
driving me crazy.

  

Mandatory details

   Trigger — background activity function

   Issue — When on “Do not disturb” mode can’t turn off notification sounds on my most used apps like Telegram, Messenger, Slack.

   Explanatory gifs/pictures — 

  
On the pictures, it can be seen a function that I found within the Settings
tab - “background activity” which automatically enables notifications from
some apps. I believe that’s the trigger of the issue but not sure.

[@Alexandre](/u/alexandre), you guys should also make use of the beta channel
that we can see in the “about station” window. I registered as a beta tester
but never saw anything from it. You should release your new versions there to
get early adopters feedback before submitting to everyone. Doing that, users
who need stable environment will be less impacted by buggy updates. (if the
beta channel is working of course…)

It’s true we are not using the beta-channel anymore.

Actually, we replaced it with a parallel release cycle that we call “Canary”
that is relatively unstable but that we keep only for us or very close

This, indeed, helped us catch a lot of bugs… but today, this one slipped thru.

We might re-introduce a beta-channels for larger audience at some point.

After every update, Station closed and opened itself again. And: everything
was gone. Like, I was completely “logged out” of Station. Station behaved as
if I was opening it for the first time. I thought “Okay, bug, let’s login
again, maybe then everything is there again”. No, it wasn’t, went through the
whole setup process, added all my apps again, only to find that everything
was duplicated after I closed and opened Station the next time. I removed
all duplicate apps and - as long as there was no new update - Station behaved
normally. Recently, same thing again.  
My workaround until now: Station installs update, opens up, asks me to login
with my Google Account, I don’t, instead I just close it, open it again, and
voilá, everything’s back without me having to login to Google and add all apps
anew again, only to find it duplicated (or even tripled, as it was the first
time) again.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that I downloaded Station yesterday, looks good. Added some
apps, just working. Today I open it again, I see profile picture of somebody
completely else? And the app says “You and your 11 teammates save …”, where do
that come from??? or does the app search a profile-photo for itself,
considering my login mailadress? Strange behaviour to see a completely other
person as my profile photo… Didn’t set a photo for myself yesterday.

Thanks [@giokincade](/u/giokincade) for your feedback!

Indeed, we changed the `Ctrl+Tab` behavior to cycle through the recently used
applications and pages. However changing the behavior of `Command-Alt-Arrow`
was not intended and we’ll fix it in the next versions.

Hey everyone

This should be fixed in Station’s version 1.17.  
Could you update your Station then remove / re-add FindThatLead and tell us
if it’s been solved for you?

To update, just open the preferences (from the top bar menu) and click the

Hi [@subo](/u/subo) !

We know we have a blank page problem, we are trying to fix it, we’re sorry.

Hello [@subo](/u/subo)

Unfortunately, I can’t reproduce this problem. Duolingo is working in our

Did you also try to close and re-open Station? We have a new update today, try
to have the last version of Station and re-install Duolingo.

I’ll check with the tech team what we can do about that.  
Thanks for your understanding.

I’m using Station version 1.46.1,  
I tried several things:

   Closing and reopning station
   Removing and re-adding Duolingo app
   Reloading the Duolingo app
   Resetting the Duolingo app

I’m on OSX Mojave 10.14.6, with Safari Version 12.1.2 (14607.3.9) as default

It loads on Safari, Firefox and Chrome on my Mac, but somehow just doesn’t

Brief description of the issue

When I try to log in with my company google account, after supplying my work
e-mail it shows me only white blank screen.

Most probable cause for this and suggested solutions

Log in with Google Apps accounts for businesses redirects to company-specific
URL that does the user authentication. In my company it redirects to a blank
page that pops up a browser user/login window (just like when accessing a
resource with HTTP basic). Here is a screenshot from safari (where it works
correctly):

It looks like Station does not provide a HTTP basic login window so there is
only a blank screen.

If that is the case - there are two possible solutions to this:

  1. Make station login window show HTTP basic auth popup.
  2. Make it possible to authenticate through external browser that has every bits and pieces required for this to work.

If you are using the app from AppImage file you need to take care of the
correct .destktop file.

Go to `~/.local/share/applications/` and look for either station.desktop
or browserx.desktop. If there is not any, just create it on the base of
any other desktop file. Point the path to the place where AppImage is, set
proper icon path, etc.

First, thank you very much for the reply. I’m a bit lost, I just started out
on Linux and I’d appreciate a few more pointers.

I’ve checked `~/.local/share/applications/` and there is neither
station.desktop nor browserx.desktop. There is a file called
appimagekit-browserx.desktop. I’ve opened it and it links to the correct
location of my AppImage. I have copied the file and renamed it as
browserx.desktop , but so far there has been no change.

What do you mean when you say “create it on the base of any other desktop
file”? And how do I determine the proper icon path?

Also, what do you mean with ""the default .desktop is in
`/usr/lib/station/browserx.desktop`""? I’ve checked `/usr/lib/` and there’s no
directory called `station`.

","

The name of the .desktop file doesn’t matter much. Open various desktop files
and analyze the structure. It’s not complicated, for example:

Name= decides what name is shown in the start menu and what you can search  
Exec= os the command that launches the program, most of the times the name
of the app is the command, sometimes it’s a path to a bin file or some other
file on the system  
Categories= decides in which menu categories the app shows up  
Icon= points to the icon of the app, installed apps usually have the name
of the app and the icon is found, because it’s registered in system in other
places, but you can point a path to the icon path so you can create your own
icon, put it where you want and then point to it in this line, so if there is
an issue with the default icon, just create it yourself  
Comment= shows up in some menu entries as a description of a program

Most installed programs have .desktop files in `/usr/share/applications/`. You
can copy any of those files to `~/.local/share/applications/` and tweak it.
Some apps already do that, others don’t and use the file on root. If you have
a file in your user folder it is used over the one in root. The same is with
configs.

I use the installed version of station and it resides for me in
`~/.local/share/applications/`. If you use appimage, it won’t be there.

Appimages are awkward. They will work no matter where they are. Some will
integrate with the desktop when you first launch it and that means: they
create .desktop file. If you move the appimage, you break the paths that are
saved in .desktop file so you need to update it to the new place.

If a .desktop file doesn’t exist you can create it manually. Just open any
text editor and save the file as appname.desktop. As to the content you have
to figure it out by checking other .desktop files.

Broken icons is a relatively frequent problem. I would download some station
icon from the net, named it properly and then put a path to the file in
.dekstop.

Just play with ,desktop files

I’ll give this a try. I really appreciate the long reply!

What do you mean when you say you’re using the installed version of Station?

I’m using Manjaro. Station is open source so it always can be installed on any
Linux system via compilation from source. However, on Arch based systems we
have access to AUR so we can find most apps there. AUR offers recipes that can
be used to install programs.

When I check the source for such AUR recipe I see:

[https://github.com/getstation/desktop-app-
releases/releases/download/${pkgver}/Station-${pkgver}-x8664.AppImage](https://github.com/getstation/desktop-
app-
releases/releases/download/%24%7Bpkgver%7D/Station-%24%7Bpkgver%7D-x8664.AppImage)

So this is an install from AppImage, so my guess is, it’s unpacked, got rid of
dependencies and installed the native way by the PKGBUILD recipe.

The pro of such installed format is that it takes less space, less system
resources and it will be automatically updated by package manager, unlike
AppImage.

There are some small cons too. Latest update from AUR was ahead with
dependencies on Manjaro. Since I am on testing branch, I got those
dependencies after few days, but someone on stable branch would have to wait
few weeks. Of course there are workarounds for it and such dependency issues
happen rarely so this isn’t really an issue.

If you want to know what is the outcome of such dependency mismatch is that
after Station update that needs newer libraries won’t work till system won’t
update to those version of packages. You can always roll the app back to older
version or switch the branch, update system to get the app working.of the app
that work

Found a dirty workaround for this. Just add a space before and after your app
name: `Teamwork` becomes `Teamwork` (replace `` with a space character).

This way you can request the app.

Do you have a specific service with which this happens?  
I’m asking because the only one that consistently logs me off is Salesforce,
which uses some sort of timer: if you’re inactive for `x` amount of time,
they’ll log you off automatically.

Hey [@RomainLiblau](/u/romainliblau),

Thanks for reaching out!  
One solution would be for us to ask for the company subdomain when a user adds
Lucca to their Station (like we do for Slack: <https://cl.ly/rxU1>).

Do you think that would solve the issue?  
If yes, can you:

   give me the format of the login URLs? (example: [yourcompanyname.lucca.com](http://yourcompanyname.lucca.com))
   confirm that this format is always the same?

Hey everyone

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that when in Outlook, Outlook Pro or Office 365 in Station,
keyboard shortcuts do not work and are overridden by the default shortcuts for
station. For example, Command+R should reply to an email, but instead it
refreshes the page. This problem suddenly appeared this morning, and I am
trying to figure out if it is a Station problem or an Outlook problem.

Interestingly the problem only appears if using the “new” Outlook on the web,
the old version works fine. Also if opening Outlook on the web from Chrome
directly in either ‘new’ or ‘old’ form, then shortcuts work as the should.

I have restarted my computer, and uninstalled and reinstalled Station. The bug
is still there:

<https://gyazo.com/9ee895d3fb6e112634455b6ed71190ef>  

Please see gifs and pictures above.  
Other things to note: switching between desktop windows outside of station
stops working, and running pages on google chrome becomes extremely slow. The
only way to solve everything is to run task manager, and spam click end-task
to quit station.

Until this bug is fixed, there’s no way for me to use Station anymore, so I’ll
uninstall it until later notice.

Hey [@Ohzie](/u/ohzie),

Thanks a lot for this thorough report  That’s indeed really weird  
I’m having a hard time reproducing this bug: could you send me diagnostic
files so I can investigate further?

  1. Your [logs](http://faq.getstation.com/bugs-not-that-we-have-any/facing-a-major-bug-and-find-no-answer-in-this-faq)
  2. Your [Station database](http://faq.getstation.com/bugs-not-that-we-have-any/facing-a-major-bug-and-find-no-answer-in-this-faq)
  3. A screenshot of your activity monitor/task manager while Station’s running

Just [send me](https://cl.ly/df286a) those 3 [by direct
message](https://cl.ly/saDl) & we’ll dig into your issues.

Have an awesome day!

Okay, so a few things:  
Unfortunately the amount of data I can upload is limited because it’s a work
computer with all my company data in it, so this will not be as helpful as I
wish it could be, but here goes:

This error occurred a little bit before it shut down…pretty much every time.  
I wasn’t sure what was causing it, so I just started removing apps one at a
time, and it looks like I’m not crashing when I remove Google Chat. NOT
hangouts. Hangouts is fine, and doesn’t break anything. Very specifically this
is the Google Chat that comes with GSuite now. I’ll check back and update this
ticket if I’m wrong and it shuts off again, but so far I’ve been going several
hours with no crash so I’ll count it as a win.

I’m sorry again about not being able to upload my station database.

Well, I thought that I could restore it using the previous version but it
turns that I cannot because the configuration has been upgraded to the new
version and when running the v1.44.1 I got this error

everything.

It looks that I found the problem.

I remembered that today I updated some Pacman packages and I didn’t reboot my
machine so I thought that it could be the problem. I tried to restart and now
I’ve been running for 30 minutes without any issue.

I’ll keep under observation during the following hours.

I can confirm that it’s working well.

I really like the new Quick-Switch design, however, it seems that its location
makes my cursor more susceptible to be hovering over an item I don’t want to
select when I activate Quick-Switch using control-tab. I often use control-
tab to quickly switch between two different apps, but with the new Quick-
Switch I find that I don’t always switch between the most recently used app.

This could be user error, but it isn’t clear what I’m doing wrong if it is.

Hey [@thomas](/u/thomas) & [@bengreeno](/u/bengreeno)

This should be fixed in Station version 1.30

To update, just open the preferences (from the “Station” top bar menu) and
click the “Check for updates” button on the right.

When I search for something and press enter, it go to the next found text.

is controlled by holding shift in other browsers.

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that I can’t add working additional favourite pages in iCloud.

  

Mandatory details

   Trigger —

   Issue

  1. Add iCloud, sign in,
  2. ‘Add a new page’ - iCloud home opens again
  3. Click an app - eg Reminders
  4. Hover over iCloud - it now contains “Home” and “iCloud Reminders”. You can switch back and forth fine.
  5. Hit the  next to “iCloud Reminders”
  6. Restart Station
  7. Station starts on iCloud home
  8. Clicking “iCloud Reminders” does nothing.

This is just one presentation of the issues around interacting with iCloud in
station. The ultimate goal is for me to have Station pages for several of the
iCloud apps, so that I can jump to them with the quick switcher. Everything
works with other apps, but I can’t find the right set of steps to create
working secondary pages for iCloud in Station.

I just noticed that the document in question is also showing up under the

","

To complete the bug report, here goes more details when I try to log in two
Gmail accounts that are "" school accounts"" (ending in .edu) ==>

For the first school account, email01@workschool.edu, I can log in without
tweaking anything. It takes two, if not three steps to complete, as the school
account is managed by Google and protected by Duo (a 2-step verification
service). The steps include: 1. feed the full email to Google’s Gmail sign-in
page; 2. this brings me to the school’s sign-in page, which takes my username
+ password; 3. it prompts me a Duo verification step, where I need to approve
the log-in through the phone App. So far, so good.

When I tried to add the second school account, email02@workschool.edu, I can
go through Step 1 and Step 2, and normally, this second school account does
not require the third step, as it is not 2-step protected for now.

However, after repeating the two log-in steps for the second school account, I
will only be prompted with the Gmail interface for the first school account.
All my attempts to log into the second school accounts are not registered to
Station.

PS: I am confused by the simply reply “You can definitely do that”. Is it
meant for confirming the bug, and affirming the fix? If so, I FAILED to
replicate the Inbox procedure on my “work-work machine”, owned by the School
and located physically in my office ==> although I went through the “Inbox
route”, I will get sent to a random Gmail account that I have already logged
in. This can sometimes happen by replacing the last App from the left-column.

Hey [@ajswanson](/u/ajswanson),

Thanks for reporting this bug: I’ve managed to reproduce it on my side!  
The good news is there’s an easy workaround : after you get stuck, double
click on AgoraPulse’s icon in Station’s dock (to hard refresh the page) then
clock again on the “Login with facebook” button and it should work.

Hope this helps

This should be fixed in Station’s version 1.16.0.

Hello [@AnzorAsadov](/u/anzorasadov),

A new update is available! Station 1.50.1. In this one we fixed the fact that

Upgrade your Station, reset again your App Store by doing a right click and
“Reset Current Application”, then you should see your store again.

Tell us if it worked for you!

This isn’t just in Windows 10. I have the same problem on Linux (multiple

Hello [@KAZUSHIASANO](/u/kazushiasano)!  
Sorry about that, it seems that it’s a problem from Slack and not from
Station. We noticed yesterday they had notifications problems and it might
have came back. We tested it on Chrome and Station, and it works again for us.
Maybe the fix will just take a little more time to work for you.

On another note, you can also verify that Slack isn’t mute in your Station

Hello [@nlite10](/u/nlite10)

Thanks for your feedback! We have actually changed the way windows positions
are remembered upon restarts because we had important issues in some cases
that made windows disappearing. Latest updates include a bug fix that ensure
windows never disappear anymore. We took care of only fix bugs and not change
previous expected behaviours, but you might have fallen in a particular case.

Could you tell us more about:

   the number of screens
   their positions and sizes
   if they are plugged in or not when closing and opening Station

Also, I’m not sure if we use the same window position algorithm than the
Spotify app, but the fact that you experience the same issue could help us
understanding your case.

Thank you

Brief description of the issue

My problem is that … When I open Station I receive a “Welcome back Charles!
You look great today! The big black button will get you back to your beloved
workspace.” But…There is not big black button? I jet get a small Station
screen that is white on the left side and blue on the right with little
circles in it.

Hi [@dyilm](/u/dyilm),

I asked our tech team and you can try 2 more options:

   Either, follow these instructions:

  1. Quit Station
  2. Download SQlite for your platform:

   Mac: [https://sqlite.org/2019/sqlite-tools-osx-x86-3300100.zip](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsqlite.org%2F2019%2Fsqlite-tools-osx-x86-3300100.zip)
   Windows: [https://sqlite.org/2019/sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3300100.zip](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsqlite.org%2F2019%2Fsqlite-tools-win32-x86-3300100.zip)
   Linux: [https://sqlite.org/2019/sqlite-tools-linux-x86-3300100.zip](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsqlite.org%2F2019%2Fsqlite-tools-linux-x86-3300100.zip)

  3. Decompress the downloaded zip, and open a Terminal/Console
  4. Execute the following statement, depending on your OS:

   Mac: `cd <extracted-folder-path> && chmod +x ./sqlite3 && ./sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Station/db/station.db ""DELETE FROM ""authToken"";""`
   Windows: `<extracted-folder-path>/sqlite3.exe %appdata%/Station/db/station.db ""DELETE FROM ""authToken"";""`
   Linux: `cd <extracted-folder-path> && chmod +x ./sqlite3 && ./sqlite3 ~/.config/Station/db/station.db ""DELETE FROM ""authToken"";""`

OR

   Do a fresh start of Station by following indications on this page. You will have to re-install all your apps.  
<https://faq.getstation.com/en/articles/1081111-how-can-i-get-a-fresh-start-

Hope this time it will work for you

When I see this screen, I click on the Google logo and it directs me to the
search page. There I search for whatever I want and go to the page (Google
Calendar or Google Keep whatever) it stays there. Until you right click and
choose “Reset this application”

Hope this temporarily helps…

Cheers

Right, after 5 minutes it went back to MS error “we can’t log you in at the
moment”.  
I “forgot” the login and logged back in, works now.  
Weird but maybe adding an option to purge cookies from apps would help solving
issues like this

Is there anyone that knows what causes this?  
Each time I open Station I have to wait 5 minutes for the blank Teams screen
to go to a Teams error.  
I have to log out and back in to get the app working.  
I’m sure something can be done ?  
This seems to be a cookies/session issue?

Station was pulling the icon for the app, and personal gmail app from

<https://en.gravatar.com/site/check/>

Once I figured that out, I logged on using wordpress and replaced my old logo

NB I still had to update station to the latest version before the changes
happened, maybe restarting it will do the same.

Hope that helps!

I noticed the same. I think is because Station is trying to check if it can
open the link internally, by prompting the user to open the link using its
respective app inside Station.

Is there a way to disable this? It bugs me that it automatically creates/opens
a new app for a specific link I click and and I tell Station to open the link
in the browser, the link sent to the browser is usually the root domain of the
site and not the actual link I clicked. I need to go back to Station and click
the link again.

I think I figured out the issue here - this can probably be closed.

I run Karabiner Elements for my WASD keyboard when I’m plugged into my docking
station, and for some reason it was interfering with my MacBook keyboard
shift+esc (mark all as read) combination.

TL;DR quitting Karabiner Elements fixed this issue.

Yes, i just noticed this as well. This is a huge problem. I just noticed
it seems to work within the station community app, but not in other apps like

Hi

Similar on Linux but not after screen lock.  
I have the white screen after relaunching Station.  
This white screen sits there for about 3-5 min then goes to auth error.  
When you log back in it works.  
Something to do with cookies/session.  
I reported it here but no reply
